Hi, good evening.  Hi, good evening how are you? thank you so much for taking time to do this hope you're doing well.  Yes I am. Thank you. No problem Yes, sir. Okay. Yes. So I'm just to get straight into it. I'm going to share a link so on the link is a website so we'll go to the website together and I would just like to hear your honest feedback to let to know if the messaging on said website is what we want it to be. And something that will resonate to our target audience. So I'm going to paste the link in the chat box. Are you comfortable with sharing your screen so that as you're going through, I can see that as well. Once I'm good okay. This is the link. Yes. Yes, the link is in the chat box.  can you see my screen? Um, yes, perfect. Yes. I can see your screen. Okay. So let's just get straight into it. So I'm like I said before this products right is to validate the product discovery stage for startups. So I'm service we are offering the products to the service. We'll be getting extents to help you do the research in surveys everything and all you have to do is just take all the insights from them from said research to use into your product ideas, and, you know, basically validate your product idea. let me give you a minute to go through the websites a minute or two. I'll just ask them questions based on each of the aspects each of the areas. So please let me know when you've taken you know, in good look at it. Just give me like one minute no problem. Just give me like one minute hold on. So I mean, I've been in another meeting and I'm just waking up properly. So usually no problem as always product market fit. That I'm guessing get started on code doesn't work yet because a form problem. So now what exactly are you asking me Are you asking me if I can resonate with the content of this website? Yes, we are going to go through it from the hero section down to two questions based on each.  So you're asking me questions or I'm asking you questions. Your line is breaking in bits can you hear me? Your line is breaking.  Yes, yes. I can hear you. Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. Now. Okay, perfect. So I'm going to ask you questions based on the parts of the websites that I can see okay.  Can you can you start I have limited time first question is, What is your overall impression of this message I can see where accelerate product Market fit.  So what is your first impression when you first see this part of the website and what stands out to you positively or negatively?  To be honest, I wouldn't read this other part down. I'll probably just read accelerate market fit as close to the next okay now I want to see okay, what do you mean by accelerate market fit? So what caught my attention? Is product market fit? Okay, that is what Okay, okay. Okay. Thank you very much for that. So if you read the article, the paragraph underneath accelerates product market fit. Does the message resonate with any challenges you feel like they founder would reasonate with?  No, Candid opinion is how do I put this is you are trying to market to people to people that are looking for quick solutions that work really Well, we've been sold a lot of marketing like startups, startup founders, also do a lot of marketing. So once I can see that you're hitting me with marketing. Yeah. I'll probably just probably skip like right here. It's that you're trying to sell so many things within these three lines, deeply understand the customer, validate your solution, your attraction test your business model, launch your products. How many? Extend your runway? Like I'm not I'm not going to get too excited like Oh, because it's like it's how they say the if you look at short straight captions that that hits you have like seven things. I already know that. There's something fishy here. Like, what exactly are you selling?  Okay. Okay. I do understand that feedback. Thank you. Very much. So let's move to the next stage. The next section. Yes is the problem.  So from what I see here, how do like the phrases resonate with you the wasting time burning cash building the wrong products, and like have you encountered any of these problems as a founder?  I'm myself, I'm a technical founder. I write a lot of code. Actively I still as good yesterday. So Burning cash and building the wrong products. I can't resonate to building the wrong products because     I see building startups like you have to be like volatile. And you should not get to the point where you can identify that isn't the wrong product. Swiftly pivot from one to another. Maybe not completely, but doing new exciting things. From from from time to time. It doesn't have to be the same brand but start a new business startup a new startup be fast move it. burning cash. Startups again, most likely doesn't they don't have cash. They are looking for cash. Yeah. Now, what you're saying to me is okay, the end goal of all these things is to get cash. Now, you're going to sell to me that you've taken half of my problem away. Okay, by me looking for so basically if I'm coming to you, I know at the end of the day, I want to get a product that is right that I can sell to the users I can sell to investors so they can get the cash. Yes, that's true. Yeah, I probably don't have I don't have the cash. I probably just have an idea. Okay, okay. I get what you mean. Yeah. So now it also now forms into the fact that there are different startups grades, startup levels. There are those that just have an idea. those are still your customers. There are those that have an idea they have an MVP because as your customers and they're testing markets, that those already have customers coming in where the customers are dropping off. Sure. So that still scopes under the product market fit. Because they've seen. this is what happened to us at StoreJars. This is literally what we are facing right now. Like is it makes sense but it doesn't define market fit because they're not going to come back and pay $20 A month this amount of dollars a month for this and that they won't do that. So you need to know revalidate your actual product. And check again, your markets. What do they really want? So you can compare us to somebody that has an idea or somebody are looking for customers. We have over 2000 people came on board. Yeah. So now if you had to tell me Churn Rate. it's Yeah, so it is when you are losing users? Yes, yes. I'm familiar with the term. They'll probably be I'll be like, Okay, can you actually help me reduce it? If you now tell me you can help me reduce. I'll know you're lying. Because technically you can't. Yeah, well, you can also see these are these are this is I'm giving I'm going to charge you per hour. Why can tell me that I will believe is there's a difference between I will help you reduce your churn rate than okay. I will help you identify the points in which your churn rate is coming from those are two different teams. so what you have now sold to me is that okay, Victor Can you hold on one second? Oh no problem. What you've now sold to me is okay can see that people are not doing as well again. These are the places that we noticed that your your customer you seem not to satisfy your customers. And it could be as simple as the customers not understanding the journey or the customers not ,we are not even positioning ourselves properly. The product is good market is good, but we just missed that inch opposition and it could be as simple as price is too much. You can't help me reduce my churn rate but you can only help me identify where my churn rate is coming from.  Yes, yes, yes I do. You do. You are making sense. Rather, I do understand what you mean by reducing churn rates are like it helps identify what is actually causing said churn. Okay, thank you very much. You can move to the next section now. The one that hold on this power is a building event products. Again, yes. It depends on how I feel like I should be able to audit my own startup do I'm auditing this. This is the thing about you can see mistakes other people can't mistake yourself. So you building the wrong product? Yes, actually, I think i should even do what you are doing more. so building the wrong product. can you really tell me that. Oh, hey, you're building the wrong products. I see. I see your point.  You can't like I've had this idea. I've seen this and that like, but you have you basically for me. Oh, I can help you identify. Identify and i can help you visualize. I don't know if this is it.  Yes, I do understand what you mean. Is just I feel like it's if I'm correct. What's your trying to say is that it is not just about saying okay, I was really considered is mostly this are the areas where you work on and this is how you can make it better. This is what we can actually do for you. Because the next thing now actually is when you build this finish they would now come and ask you is it the product , right or wrong? Yeah, do they expect yes or no answer. And you can't give them a yes or no answer. By the end deeply understand your target customer     Speaker 2 20:43   So people don't read. People are not going to read all this. How do you know your customer what are their most severe pains? how are they addressing them today. how much are they spending to do that? Five customer interviews won't cut it. I won't seat down and read all these. But what you're trying to say here is okay? I'm guessing what you're trying to say is. they need to understand their customers better because that's the only way. and for yu to understand the customer better, Yes. You need to communicate with your customers. Basically, are you going to communicate on to their customers on their behalf? Are you going to tell them how to communicate with their customers? What exactly are they're going to do? Understand.     Speaker 1 21:55   As regards that, right? Like I said, you know, the whole point is to validate the product idea. So we're going to take that idea and then interview your target customers or ideally who the target customers should be and then you know, gather insights based on that. So instead of five interviews or those like six or seven, you know, most people normally do wewould have like more interviews like 50 plus. So that's the information you're getting based on said feedback.  I feel like the most important part is now so hidden. Because I would have missed that part. So what you're saying is me myself, me and my team we can't do 500 customer surveys But, you can do that for us and do all the analysis and give us feedback. Okay, that makes sense. Okay, so you can scroll up I mean, I think you. So, yeah, what are you doing here? He's just basically talking about how we're going to after the interviews, we'll try to run experiments with your target audience to further understand, okay, so the interviews are the first stage where we interview them to find out okay, this is what their pain points are, this is what needs to be solved. And then we further dive deeper into those pain points with further interviews so that's what the validation experiments are for.  Okay. Basically, after you've interviewed you can also give this the solution to the users to like engage them get their feedback also. So basically, they would also Yes, apart from telling them about the problem, they will test out the solution. And see if the solution fits.  Exactly.  Yes, so I have a question as regards the externship clients section. So once you see these people right, do they influence your view of products seeing that okay, people like snapshats, energy innovation capital, you know, they are people that have used this products? does that influence your view of said products No I can actually just saw it as a front. Because if you're telling me you're targeting startups yeah. Okay, and Snapchat has been around since 2008. you're not their clients we know or seems like it. Beat by dre is not a, all these people hp. hp. hp started hardware since when you need a full room to be a computer they are not your clients. Energy Innovation capital. If you now tell me oh, this startup. Basically, I want to see a success story of a startup that I just had on tech cabal and all these blogs like two weeks ago. I see them here and be like oh, you're the one that helped those guys. You didn't help Snapchat to get to where they are.  Well, fair enough. Fair enough. Okay, um, thank you so much for that insight actually um, so let's move to the advantage section.  I need to get on a call  Okay, so just we are almost done. So sorry. So for the call, to action part this gets started. So the call to actions exists. Yes, exactly. Yes. is it something you would do and input your details on first view or the second view when you go through it, and what would hold you back or any reservations where you feel like you would not click on get started button you don't click on the Get Started. It opens up to something here. My name my address Number of employees, phone number. I think yeah, this is fair. Um, if I see that Oh, okay. But there's one thing like missing in the sense of now... What is missing? So there's how they do it. There's something they call it where instead of get started, it should be something more like exciting like a call to action or something like, 'contact us now that kind of Oh. It makes like I'm starting something. Yeah. Okay. Something like, oh, we are ready to like listen to this, how they put it. I've noticed what I see. I think would ready to work with us be an appropriate thing? To say something about that. Like maybe work with us or speak with us? yeah that kind of thing. just so that the user knows that okay, We are ready to like discuss with you and take your business forward.  Basically, they just want to know that this is what you can do for your business asap. Like Contact us now. Book a demo. I think the reason why they do book a demo, because you could actually say Book a demo because now you've not shown me any products. Well let's say you've updated all these texts, and the website looks exciting. Yeah and you tell me book a quick demo. I'll be like okay Let me book a demo. And so one other problem with it is that people may think, these people would waste my time. You can tell them it shouldn't take more than 10 minutes and we'll be on call with you like us. Like you can put a Calendly link and schedule a session. Okay, okay. Okay.  These people have a meeting with me. We'll reach out to you as soon as possible.", No. , n/a , n/a , n/a , burning cash and building wrong product , n/a , Wasting time resonated most. , n/a , burning cash ," Startups again, most likely doesn't they don't have cash. They are looking for cash. Yeah. Now, what you're saying to me is okay, the end goal of all these things is to get cash. Now, you're going to sell to me that you've taken half of my problem away. Okay, by me looking for so basically if I'm coming to you, I know at the end of the day, I want to get a product that is right that I can sell to the users I can sell to investors so they can get the cash ", Did not resonate. , partially reasonated , Did not resonate , n , N , It resonated well. , Maybe. ," The interviewee recommended reconsidering the call-to-action term, pointing out that get started might not be the most suitable option. Instead, he proposed using terms like contact us now or book a demo. If the latter is chosen,he  advised specifying a duration, such as 10-15 minutes, and including a Calendly link for scheduling. This, according to the interviewee, would offer a more compelling and actionable approach for users. ", Book a demo , The interviewee emphasized the need for overall messaging to be more concise and straightforward.  , He suggested avoiding long blocks of text to prevent users from skipping crucial information. Highlighting important parts and ensuring clarity are key factors to eliminate confusion and prompt users to better understand the product. 
Sellie,Phillip Oyewale,Pre-seed stage,Sellie offers businesses a range of tools to build and manage an online store.,https://www.getsellie.com/,B2,E-commerce,Founder | </Developer> interested in Artificial Intelligence,"Hi Phillip. if you are speaking your mic is muted no problem. Hi how are you doing today? All right. Fantastic. So I want to say thank you so much for taking time to participate in this. I would really love your feedback. So let's just get straight to it. So the thing is I would love your input on a particular aspect of it. The main goal of this session is to understand your reactions as received with the product messaging. Right. So to briefly explain the product in itself. Yeah, we are using externs and AI to validate product discoveries. even if your product is AI are related, we are going to help you validate the idea using AI tools. So this would include helping to conduct interviews like helping you through interview stage and that data. So if at all you have a new feature or a new product again, we're able to validate it like let you know that okay, this product has a product market fit that you need so that you do not lose money or burn cash or anything like that. So is that okay? yeah, makes sense. Okay,Okay, fantastic. Okay, so I'm guessing you're noy joining with your laptop?  No, I'm joining with my phone.  Lets send the link in the chat box.  I'm going to share my screen so we can go through together. So the whole point is for you to let me understand what you can see from this. So as a founder, this solution is for early stage startups, right. And as a founder we feel like you're part of the target audience so we're trying to validate the idea and see how best we can help you with your product. In a minute, let's move on     okay     Okay, can you see my screen? Yes, I can.  Okay. So, yes, yes, yes, yes. So We're going through it from the hero section down to the last part. So you're just going to tell me and i'm just going to ask a few questions based on what you can see on the screen. So this is the hero section right? the beginning. So do you need like a minute to read what's here, then I would ask the question.  Yeah, let me just go through it okay, yeah, I'm done.  Alright, so when you see this section what is your overall impression of the message? Does anything stand out to you positively or negatively? And most particularly, does the messaging resonates with any challenge that you're constantly?  Yes. Accelerating product like getting product market fit for founders. is one of the most challenging things actually, its the point that you get to where everybody wants to use your products for the market you are building for. So yeah, for you to tell me that you want to get me a product fit . i will be hooked.  Okay, okay. Okay. Thank you very much for that input.  So I'm going to So yes, so this is the problem segment. but something I don't really understand is the image that is used in the hero section. I don't think it portrays what you're trying to drive at.       Okay, Noted. Thank you very much for that insight. So here, this is the problem section. Take a minute to read. And then I'll ask questions as well. Yeah, you can ask now. Okay, fantastic. So these phrases under stop. wasting time, burning cash. Building your own products, like does anything resonates with you? Have you encountered any of these problems as a startup? And can you like just tell me a bit about that? Yeah, actually wasting time, like usually doesn't seem at the beginning we didn't really understand ourselves to to just get one thing done. It can take up to a week or more something that can actually be done in less than a day. Also, also limited resources, funding talent, more, especially talent, especially. And we're currently having that problem because we are supposed to have an app on the App Store. But We don't have anybody on the team that is an app developer, too. So we also have an issue with talent and it's causing us to waste time and from the feedback I've gotten an app is very, very important. And up till now we don't have one.  Okay. duly noted. Thank you so much for that. So I'm going to move on to the next section. And you let me know what you think about it. So just take some time, like a couple of seconds to glance through and then when you're done, I would ask questions.  Yeah, Go ahead.  Okay, thank you. Um, so for the for this section, deeply understand your target customer. What's your understanding of the feature Right? what does this tell you as a founder? once you see this, do you feel like the messaging could be better? like anything, what appeals to you and what doesn't? Okay I think it's straight to the point deeply understand your target customer which is a very, very important part. To accelerate what you are building. because your customers are the ones using your solution and they would kind of guide the way your products will be built or the way your products will grow. So if this is a feature, it is a very, very important one its one of the ways to actually achieve product market fit and getting feedback is very, very important and its something that cannot just be neglected. It's a good is a good one.  Okay. So do you think that the most important parts of messages actually like what he was trying to achieve? We achieved with this section?  Yeah, it's straight to the point ,how well do you know, customer what are their sever pains? And how are you addressing them? It's actually the most important questions and even how much how much I spend and to do that to actually get feedback from them and know, What's their problem is or their problems are.  Okay, all right. Thank you so much for that. So this is the next section let me know when you are done reading. Yeah, I'm done. Um so when you see this section, again, what appeals to you and what doesn't sound like what do you understand by it?  Okay, the, the part of making sure that your solution is in line with what your customers actually actually gets my attention because in the market, you will definitely have competition. You have to have a way to stand out. So Validating my solution with my customer, with my target customers. It's something that's very important for me, and usually it's not something that is, easily done because it's might require you to actually talk to those people.  Okay. So, the next part, okay, so this one we had already same question, what appeals to you, and what do you understand by this?  Okay, this part of the early adopters, I actually think personally, as a founder you we solve problems that we encounter, like, I don't know, maybe most up to 90% of founderssolve problems that they encounter, to the effect of getting early adopters. Usually it's from our circle, like people we know or people that we know that actually have those problems. And I also think that is the important part in using any Product because you can even if you build a good product, a great product and you cannot actually get people to use it and get people to test it out. It doesn't doesn't make any sense at all, so acquiring customers is very important, like very, very, very important.  Alright, for this section, right, where you can see the clients and you can see Beats by Dre tech ventures, Snapchat and whatnot. So does this like seeing these people that you've worked with like, does it you know, how like the influence your view of the product? Yeah, this is actually social proof. It's very important. Like immediately somebody says, I have worked with people like this. There is this increased level of trust and can I say comfort of the approach? Generally, you can deliver.  Okay. All right. Thank you very much for that. So the advantage to this section just take a look at it and let me know what you think. And like are the advantages something that are valuable to you?      Yeah, I think especially most especially the first one, because it means it means to save more time, like founders like to save more time. And time is like the most time is one of the most important things in building any product. Yeah. Okay, fantastic. So we're actually very near the end my next question would be this 'gets started button. Right, this call to action? Would you say that scene? Get started voting is something that would encourage you to actually sign up if you so it could look like this usually like messaging to be better. Do you feel like maybe the words used to be more convincing for instance?      What's going on? Yeah.  Yes, yes. He's only here as well.  Okay. Okay. Because usually, I don't know but from experience does usually if you get your message and yeah, and you have your call to action, it is one of the most capturing parts. Okay, like if you can nail your, if you can nail your messaging at your hero and there is a call to action it works actually. And also having it subsequently is so important. Because there are some people that will actually want to go through everything and just like how this one is after your your proposition that is your advantage. The call to action button works.  Okay, okay. All right. So basically, honestly, that is the end of this. Just wanted to you know, get your insights and I'm really thankful for you taking time to do this. but I cannot I cannot see some things I cannot see your pricing page. I cannot see some other pages. I don't know maybe this is just a minimal page or something.  
This is just like a prototype rights, no asides, the pricing and all that. So this is just to validate the idea and to see if what messaging we have new is good isn't what it's supposed to do or what we want it to do. So that's why the pricing here, for the most part wants to make sure that we convey the value that we are willing to give or that we'll be able to.  Okay, okay, that makes sense. Yeah, this does that's all it was very short, meeting. But thank you so much. I would just like to applaud your efforts with Sellie. Yes, very, very good product I came across It's like sweet spot and you know, I thought it would be very important for you, like, I can see that you have a very, very good product and slash solution. It's it's very important to get people like you to validate this who can help you not waste time.  Okay. Thank you very much.  Thank you so much for this meeting.  That would be all have a good day.  All right. Thank you so much.", Partially reasonate , it seems legit , n/a , n/a , Building the wrong prod ," Yeah, actually wasting time, like usually doesn't seem at the beginning we didn't really understand ourselves to to just get one thing done.

How are you?  Hey, good, good. Okay, so, hello, thank you so much for taking the time to participate in this research session. We're conducting this to gain insights on a product that's currently under development. Rest assured all your responses today will remain confidential. We'd like to record this session to ensure we capture all your feedback accurately allowing us to focus more on a conversation. Is that alright with you?  Okay, sure.  So I'm a part of a research team for a new product and today I'd love your input on a particular aspect of it. The main goal of this session is to understand your reactions and see if our products messaging resonates with you. So it's really important for me to hear your honest thoughts, so please don't hold back. Your feedback, both positive and negative will be invaluable. I'm here to listen and learn. If at any point you have questions, please. Let me know. So let's start walking through a mock website together. I'll share the link with you and if you're comfortable, please share your screen as you browse through. That way I can look at what you're looking at in real time and see your thought process. So we'll hit input the recording and not yet right. Yes, yes, it's recording.     Okay. All right. Yes. Just for the transcription. So if you can just open up the the website that I sent the chat and then share your screen so I can see what you're looking at. Okay, all right.     Alright, so let me share my screen.  Oh, you're disabled I think to enable it can I disabled it?  Let me know maybe on the participants here to give. Yeah, let me see if I can. Why isn't it letting me get the time. Okay. Yes, it should be. Yeah, I'm able to go okay, now. Yes. Okay, so here's your plan. Can you see? Yes, I can see it.  Okay. Okay, let me know. Okay, me once again. It's not letting me see it.  Okay, so this is an overview of what the company does. Please take a moment to read through it out loud and share your thoughts with me line by line. So essentially, what's the overall impression of this message and what do you take away from it? And what stands out to things?  I see you want me to go to this website and we can go section by section. So from the top I see this with the customer. Okay. Excellent.  Okay, so what's your overall impression of this message? The message is good. But to me this sounds like a very generic message. Okay. I mean, like, you know, like, this is like, this is like a mantra of any product marketing in some way. You're too old to understand where it literally fit, but we want to click on this get started, but separate.  No, that's good. Okay, what does that send out to like positively or negatively?  What would you teach? I would say neutral right now. Okay. So, more like, more like it's preaching how something has to be done as opposed to talking about a particular product itself.  Okay, all right. That's what it is. Okay, does it resonate with any like particular needs or challenges you're currently facing?  In your store, all of them are very valid, just right. I mean, absolutely. Like, look at this deeply understand your customer, of course, worry the solution. Everything is correct. Yes. That's your model. Yeah. I mean, every step every single step is correct. But if you're trying to I mean, I don't know what the goal per se, but if you're trying to build a product here and kind of sell a product, then I don't know what the product is. But if you're talking about how to actually do a product recording in progress, okay, that's what I feel. Okay, so it is about actually generally how the startups work. Right? Looks like we can all understand you a little better. Otherwise, yeah. Okay, from this perspective, AI like let's see. 90% of startups. Fail. Okay. Do you understand the brain? Now? I didn't before this about you need help. Okay, all right. So that is like how do these phrases out the side under like, stop like the wasting time burning capital in the wrong product? How do those phrases resonate with you? Have you ever encountered any of those problems? Absolutely. I mean, no, of course money always there, right? Yeah, I think the last one is what I have learned the last lots of building the wrong product. This actually is very true. You know, my own based on my own personal experience like I've done myself as part of camphor network, done something bad something for weeks, months, sometimes, without understanding this part. Without probably doing this one, if we understand your customer, that's mistaken, that if I don't do that, or if anyone doesn't do that, then it causes all of this time. So yeah, yeah, I agree. So it's important to make sure that we've been the right product, actually. Yes, that makes sense. I like it. So you're identified some key parts about you know, when the startups can fail. So let's see how you're describing each challenges deeply understand your target customer will remember what are the most severe thing I agree. Yeah, I mean, absolutely. In fact, some people suggest they even do 100 Plus thoracostomy. I mean, it really depends on the kind of product. Some products you know, you may not have so many customers, right in a b2b business. If it's a b2c Yes, sure. We'll have lots of customers. So having had 50 100 customer, follow up interviews is is minimal. But if you're doing a b2b something, you may not have survived the customer ship. So it really depends on the kind of the market your product, right?  That's right. So is that the part that like specifically appeals to you about it?  The appeals to me meaning, like, what like resonates with you from this message?  Yeah, as I said, as being a startup founder myself, every single thing you're seeing here is absolutely true. Like there's no question. There's not only thing I can contest is that this number 50 plus the output, right? So there's two kinds of businesses okay, if you're familiar with this b2c and b2b. So b2b is business to business. A b2c is business to customer. Jamba Juice is a business to customer, individual customers come in and so you can have this like this kind of 50 plus target customer for a b2c businesses. For b2b Typically these terms will ever lower. Right so you can make a little bit more specific here. Okay. That's when you validate your solution with target customers. Sure. Does your solution resonate with your customers? Is it a vitamin Yeah, I've heard is this very common face? Good one, we need a vitamin or a painkiller the switch to your product building product is expensive. Protecting your remember launch up market predicts and protect Yeah, we will run relationships great with your target audience with your chances. So okay, here it so we will run who is we? So when you visit this company? Yeah. Okay, so it's a sample company website. Right? Okay. Well, then managing your target audience increase your chances of I mean, see this one needs resonance well, but typically to me, this was more marketing than reality. Because no validation is a very loaded word. Right? It really depends on the business. So you know, like, not every business can validate every other businesses experiments. But yeah, I mean, it'd be it's absolutely great to be able to do that.  If someone can do so how would you change the wording or what would you say instead? So what I would like to if this is a this is a website trying to sell this thing, right. I would like to understand a little bit more the context so far, I don't have a context of the solution provided from this website. is a generic statement, right? to deeply understand, we'll be discussing what could be coffee customer, it could be an airline customer. I mean, it's a very generic statement. So I don't know exactly what kind of business that this can help right now. So maybe having a little bit more domain specific, might have helped to, you know, how do I put a navigate right for the customers to do  Okay, is it relevant or it's not?  Basically right, because not a, there's no way you can have a solution? solve every problem? Every so every solution is always targeted to a set of problems. Very specific domain specific, some domain information has to be there like technology. What field are you targeting? I don't see that so far. But otherwise everything is correct. I mean, I like it. Right? You're saying that you're able to help customers to really validate the solution at less cost, so that is good. Okay. It's a big traction with your early adopters. How many early adopter customers do you have? Yep. And that's very important what appreciate something was able to actually invade you or you need to be to action now. Yeah, we need to be customer. Yeah. I like it. You know, like it's very much telling people not to make the same mistakes that people typically do. And definitely helps and attractive from that perspective. So these are our partners and I guess finally consumer, right?  Yeah. So how do those like testimonials or endorsements influence your view of the product? That's an excellent question. Or advantage. So if you go to actually as if, okay, so, this company external right, whatever is selling a product, correct. So I like all the things I was talking about. But I still don't know the domain. They're like, what kind of technology? Are they targeting an airline customer are targeting a food industry. So I don't have that visibility so far. Maybe it's the tone that usually she will talk I think, right.  So this is going back to the externship clients include part so how do those testimonials or endorsements influence your view of the product?  Yes, absolutely. I mean, nothing is more than a testimonial because especially because you know, today's word digital world, a lot of crap comes in, you know, the fake news the big contains, you don't know what is true, what is false, right? Everybody's trying to solve everybody's trying to market so having a testimonial is most one straightforward way to kind of cut the crap you know, remove all the father and focus on real versus fiction. So that helps. So I this is good. In fact, you can even have more ports also having quotes and testimonials.  We can Yes, our advantage Okay, fully managed. We manage the entire project contain expert lane. Okay. So yeah, highlighting the key factors meanings. We started to look for some teams where it was possible better. That's good for those or is that something important? Or valuable to you those advantages, or?  Yeah, fully manage is important, right? Because sometimes you don't want to. Okay, from here what I can see. Now I get that this looks like as a little bit of a consulting service, perhaps, where you're saying that you're going to manage one thing by thought of yourself the company would manage so as a customer, I don't have to have any worry, right? You kind of manage everything. So more consulting sense which is good. Pricing has to be there somewhere that will come right how do you price so far? I don't see it. Right. It's all says you can do that and there's no I don't see a link in pricing ideally. I would like to see pricing. Because there's always competition. There's always alternatives. Right? Right. But I like the single page clean flow. There's not too much. You know, hitting you in the face. Right? With pictures is good. You know, team is always nice. I guess this will be links, which is good. So you can obviously kind of find out more. So this is good. You know, copyrights very important. Okay, yeah. Social media is good, too. Yeah. So the only thing I would say is that yeah, tell me a little bit more context. Like for example from what I got here. Here, like all the way down here, right? I was able to send this okay. You are providing people teams, right. So basically what you're saying up staff, so you're you're helping to staff, your customers, right? That's what it is, but it's way down here. So maybe they should be something a little bit more upfront as to what you will do. Maybe somebody can say, we help build better teams, or we help you build teams. What's your motto? Where is the motto of you? Like a slogan, right? Like a single word or that that will be useful, I think to filter out whether it's relevant or not relevant. Okay. Another thing I want to understand is a module the meaning of this particular picture here, in a sense, is this has a relevance. There's a I see there's a computer. There's a monitor, there's a desk, but I don't know that is irrelevant, or it's just something and I don't know, I'm not able to fill in the blank here. But something I maybe put a better picture perhaps I'm not able to relate this with this. Right. Okay, right. But this is good, right? You're solving these kind of issues your help as you know, stop we help us to stop wasting time. Spend less money and that's good. So yeah, this is good. This is all nice to see what else so you really contact address here. That's another thing I would want like where are you based? Right is based in the United States are no familiar abroad. Usually I personally like to see an address. Like no, like I won't have a confidence it's a real company real team is a real location, right? So that would be good to have at least where it is based. On an email address. You do have Facebook, Twitter, and email. We'll be good. For any additional questions. There'll be something nice to learn. Yes, that makes sense. Let's see what is feedback.  If you click the Get Started, button, the purple Get Started button.  Yeah. All right. Let's see.  So okay, do you like consider, like filling this out? Like would like after seeing this mock mock website? Like would you want to fill this out like what are your thoughts on this?  Ah, okay, the good part is phone number is not required. That's good. Because you make phone number as required. A lot of people will not give it so it's kind of a bummer. So that's good. So this is all good come title company. This is all standard. Well enough. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty easy to pull in there. That's pretty good. Speed. But yeah, that's fine. I think this looks reasonably small. Because the longer the forms are, you know, your driver and more people, like people will just just people are so literally time. nothing missing. Yes, you can add or remove. I wouldn't even get rid of. Yeah, maybe you can keep it more than most people don't get a phone number anyway. So that's fine. Let's see.  After seeing like this mock website would you consider filling that out for your own company? Are you gonna repeat it actually having a Yeah, like after seeing this whole like website we consider, like filling that get started? form out?  Yeah, absolutely. Because see, I have all these problems, right. These are all genuine problems, which pretty much most companies have. There's no perfect company. So there's absolutely no way I can tell that. Hey, I don't want to burn I mean, I mean, nobody wants to burn gas. So yeah. Oh as I said before, just a little bit of domain will be more useful or you already have it but way down to having a little bit more clearer here saying can you help when things you help us hire right? That's what you're saying here. If I read here, we start your externship with 100% free so staffing is a key here. That's what you're doing. As part of this website, you are saying you help the staff that has to come on site in the beginning. That's the only thing I can say other means Yeah, sure. If I have a staffing issue, though, in a sense, if I'm already having enough people, you know, then it's a different ballgame. Right then I had to figure out how to stop more or not, but I would definitely do get started on providers yet. Okay. Yes, sounds good.  Yeah, no, it's nice. I like the fonts. It's nothing is hitting you know, the face of testimony as I say in addition to the names, right, the quotes, the quotes exactly we have we either we call attract people, as I said, address, contact email you can put right away though I do see that. In here you have a key there's no way you have an email address. Right. You are saying if you're gonna get back, yeah. Which is fine, but sometimes it's good to have an email address so we can initiate a contract right away. You can always put it under contract as is. The other thing I would also like to keep it is yeah, these are all links eventually need to be clickable. Right? So that's what they should be clickable. ID. So I want to know who he is. Right? So I think that's fine. His parents. Okay, you have any other official or you want me to click on anything else?   Nope. That's it. Thank you so much for your insights, feedback has been immensely valuable. And please, don't give any other thoughts or questions about the process. Really appreciate your time.  Okay, if I have something I leave in you, okay. Perfect. Thank  you so much. Hey, thank you. Thank you, Sindhu. Thanks for the opportunity. I wish you all the very best, the site is very good.  Okay. Have a good night. Okay. Yeah."," Yes, it resonated well with the interviewee. "," absolutely.

Amie,Krithi Reddy,A,It's startup based in SF working on shopping personalization for GenZ women,https://www.linkedin.com/in/krithireddy/,B2C,Fashion and technology,She is a recent Stanford graduate and worked as an analyst at Blackstone.,"Hey, how's it going? Good. How are you? Good. I don't think we see each other in literally years. It's been like 10 years or like something. Yeah. Since like I was in middle school, maybe wait so where are you in college right now or yeah, I'm at college. I go to like Drexel University. It's in Philly.  Okay. Okay, cool. And this is for like a class or something.  Yeah, just like for this like project up to do.  Okay. Okay, cool. I might, my mom told me that your mom had message and it was funny because I was literally sitting like I was home that day. And I'm working on a startup right now. So like, it worked out perfectly. That's so good. Thank you so much again for doing this.  Yeah, for sure. Um, so basically, this is like an interview like a research session to like gain insights. On a product that's currently under development. So can I record this?  Yeah. recording in progress.  So basically, I'm part of the research team for new product and today, I'd love your input on a particular aspect of it. And the main goal of this session is to understand like your reactions and to see if like the product messaging resonates with you. So it's really important for me to like, hear your honest thoughts. So please don't hold back. Your feedback, both positive and negative will be invaluable. And I'm here to listen and learn. So if at any point you have any questions, please let me know. So we're gonna start by like walking through like a mock website together, and I'll share the link with you and then if you could just like share your screen as you browse through it so I can see what you're looking at in like real time. That'd be great.  Okay, sounds good.  So I'm just gonna put it in the chat okay. Oh, I think you need to, I think I changed the settings is it working now? Oh, yeah.  Okay, perfect. So basically just browse through the website like I'm looking at it. Yeah, exactly. So this is kind of like the overview of what the company does. So please take a moment to read through it out loud and share your thoughts like line by line like kind of like what's the overall impression of the message like what you take away from it like what stands out to you positively or negatively things like that. Okay, sounds good. I mean, I think that it definitely I think this title, definitely, like makes sense to me, especially if you're targeting like pre seed or seed. But I would say like, if I were to see this, I feel like I would want it to be a bit more specific on here because I think these are more like the general terms of like, oh, yeah, what you're supposed to get for product market fit but I'm not really understanding like what you guys at all would do from this. Right?  Right. Does like the message like resonate with any like particular like needs and challenges you're facing at your startup?  Um, yeah, I mean, I think deeply understand, at least for me, like we're doing a consumer product. So I feel like deeply understand your customer is definitely something that we're focused on of like, keeping track of like metrics and what exactly they like and like how they're using the product Yeah, I'm not really sure what this would be. I don't really know what this means. Yeah, I mean, I feel like validate solution. I would assume is like somewhat metric based building traction. Maybe like marketing. But yeah.  Yes. Makes sense. So is this what you're saying? That like this provides like you would provide 100 Plus customer interviews?  Yes. It's not my website.  Oh, okay.  Let's not mine.  Okay, got it.  So this part is like a section that discusses some problems people might face so like how the phrase on the side like wasting time burning cash and like building the wrong product resonate with you. Like, have you encountered any of those problems? Or like could you share more of your experience with that? Yeah, um, I feel like we haven't hit those as much like I would honestly say there's a lot of problems before you even realize, like potentially you're wasting time or burning cash or but like, I think if because we're pretty early on, I would say like, we haven't even hit a point where we could know if we're wasting time burning cash or building the wrong product. So I feel like this wouldn't resonate as much with me and maybe that's just because we're more precede and early. I would say I mean, I think these are general problems, but I feel like it would be more powerful it was if it was like a lot more specific. Yeah.  So for like, just like this one with like, your understanding of the speech or like what appeals to you what doesn't things like that?  I mean, I think I really liked this one. I think this is like a huge, like, focus for early startups. But I do again, wish that I would just a bit more specific like I think it'd be a lot more powerful if you like, because these are kind of just general questions. Want to know about your customer but like, I think a better thing would just be a lot more like specific like, know this about your consumer like know how much time they're spending on XY and Z and like I feel like that would entice me more.  That makes sense.  Yeah, I also think by the time you're like somewhat running a startup, whether it be precede or see like, you've definitely done more than five customer interviews. So there's almost seems like so so early that it's also not helpful. Like I think it should be a bit more like targeted where like, we've definitely done way more than five customer interviews, but I would still say like, we need to understand our target customer way more. So I feel like getting this to be better. Like timed would be better. I'm I think this would be interesting. I think what I guess what I feel like is why would whoever is running this be better at like testing the product than the founders themselves? So I feel like adding more of like, why? Whoever is running, this would be better at it or faster at it. Or whatever. I think we make it more powerful  I've seen mainly for this one like also like what appeals to you and like what doesn't?  I definitely like these questions. I feel like that gets at it I think I like these questions, but then I would wish that here you would explain like what you are doing to build traction or what would happen to get those early adopter customers. Yeah, so mostly like specificity.  So how do you look for the externship clients include that part? Like how did those like testimonials or endorsements influence your view of the product?  It definitely helps knowing that other people are using it so for like each of these advantages,  like what's your like initial reaction to like each advantage like is it something important or valuable to you? Um I personally I honestly don't know if I would like this like I think especially when you're early on, you're pretty hands on with everything. So I feel like I would like a point that's more so like, we work with you and figure out your needs versus like, you're just going out there and doing it by yourself because like, I guess my worry would be like you're not doing it. How I'd want it or like targeting the right stuff  um yeah, I mean, honestly, I feel like just going through this website, I'm just confused what the externship is like, I feel like that's not done very clearly about like, what exactly this company does. So it's kind of hard to like, even think about these things as I'm like, What are you doing in the first place?  Right. Yeah, that makes sense.   Yeah, I think I mean, our team's good.  I feel like maybe a bit more background on who these people are. Like, why I would think they would be good people to help me with my product.  Yeah, so like their qualifications and things like that. Yeah. So after going through like the entire page, if you could scroll below of it. There's like a Get Started button. If you just like click that. So after going through like the entire page, like how would you feel about taking the next steps like would you be inclined to get started?  Um, probably not. Honestly. I feel like I just don't know what this company is doing. So it's hard for me to like, I don't think I would be enticed to go and ask them.  Right. So you just need more like information on like, what the externship is and things like that, like more specific details of exactly what the program does, and then like very specific details.  Because honestly, like, this is probably like, I would view this as like, Oh, this is startup trying to help you get product market fit. And then like most startups are very, very specific about like the value add that they add. Like you can't just be like, oh, we'll help you find product market fit because like that's a huge thing. Like I would want it to be a lot more like this is exactly what we're going to help you do. And then I think generally you would want to know about pricing and all of that. Before you speak like before I would want to speak to someone.  Yes, definitely. Thank you so much for your insights and feedback. It's been like really valuable. And please let me know if you have any other thoughts or questions about the process. Really appreciate your time.  No, I think I'm good. Should I stop sharing my screen now? Oh, yeah. Okay, cool. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it. So is that it for just the interest that's it. Thinking cool. Yeah. Let me know if anything else pops up. I'm glad I could help recording stuff. too.

Protect your runway by launching a product market fit externship? I don't really know what those two correlations are like building product is expensive is kind of like just placed there like I guess I get the connection like building product is expensive. So you want to make sure you're building the right product. I guess that's what like that's what I got out of it. But I don't think the way it's placed is very relevant along with the Protect Your runway by launching a product market fit.  I think you just don't really need it. You can just say like, no matter what your what your solution is slash what your product is, like we'll run validation experiments with your target audience to increase your chances of success and then you can say like, what kind of validation experiments those are. "," About the first advantage: Yeah, super valuable because like, if you trust a team to do something like I don't want to be the one checking in on them all the time making sure they're doing it right. So the fact that it is fully managed and I can just give them to them don't have to worry about it and can trust that they are providing valuable feedback in return then like that would be that would be very helpful.  one question I had that was like large project teams. Like I already said this before, but if the externship has 100 person team, then then like 50 Customer discoveries, like that doesn't seem enough, you know, like 100 person team is huge, like 100 person, let's say can call 10 People like that's already 1000 customers for every you know, so like 50 is not the right number there. "," Wasting time, Burning Cash, Building the wrong product "," I feel like the limited resources and team understaffed hits home because it's really hard to test your product in the market if you don't really have the time to do it or the team to help you like, you know, like create your MVP and then keep testing it and iterating that and that's like so important. So the fact like, in my experience, I haven't, like that's been really hard. And that's one of the reasons why I kind of like let the startup kind of go because that process was so strenuous. So I really do relate to the fact.  So you're providing them with the staff to do it in a specific way. Which I think is great. ", Limited resources and understaffed teams hit the most home over the three bullet items on the right.  ," I guess it's, like, irrelevant in that but I feel like the problem section could be more clear as to like what specifically the problem the Starbucks face because I even though like 90% of startups fail. I feel like a lot of people don't really understand the importance of product market fit and like, why it's important to like, test whether your customers are actually using your product and if it's the right solution, most people just like that, like that's the reason that 90% of startups fail because there is not that product market fit. So I feel like the problem isn't that like you have limited resources, your team is understaffed. You're doing work you've never done before your list of projects is endless, and you need help. Like that's not what the problem is. It's like the problem is you need help understanding if, like your product is the right fit for the market. And that's why 90% of startups fail. So like Don't be in that 90% And we can help you be that 10% Where you know, you have the right solution, and like and that so I feel like the problem is a little bit different than what the problem should be expressed.  So I feel like the side where it says like stop wasting time burning cash building the wrong product. Maybe that could be more clear and how that plays into product market fit.  I would change the just like the way that the problem is conveyed. So I really like to 90% of startups fail, but just like connecting that to product market fit and then maybe instead of like stop, it's like, how we can help. So like this is the problem that that is contributing to the failure of startups. And then this is how we can help you. Make sure you're not in that statistic.

Overall, Andrea said it is an interesting experience.","Can you hear me? You hear me?  Yes.  Give me one second so sorry. I just found out and are you okay with this interview being recorded or are you fine with me just taking notes  Andrea  Oh yeah, it's fine for me record  so let's get to Hi my name is Min. I'm a freshman at the University of Houston and I'm taking part in this externship. It's a research project about startups. And I feel like your insights would be really good. So just a quick overview of this meeting. I'm going to show you a website that's currently under development and you're just going to react to it your responses are going to be confidential. They won't be shared. It's just for us to know how to improve the website. So when we just get the link for you and are you able to screenshare?  Are you able to screen share? Is there  Well, I'm not allowed, but I didn't understand. Yeah, I think I can give you access so. Okay, so here’s that I sent you a link in the chat Do you see the link? Open? Can you screen share? Are you able to screen share or is there  Okay, so I'm gonna have to do like, I don't really understand. So I'm gonna go get started. So this is our web page that you are developing and you want to see under development and we just want to see like, your insights on it, basically. So are you able to screen share or Thank you, okay. Before we do anything I have questions to ask.  So do you know what funding stage your businesses? Is it A, B or C? Is it now?  No, we're in C, and C.  And can you give me like a brief summary of your company and like what you guys like goals are.  So we are manufacturing bio plastics from biomass is such as Sargassum, which is an algae in the Caribbean and the moment we have optimized three Mbps and we are like next stages, see the investment around or Pilot Plant.  That's good. It's good to hear that there are companies you know helping the environment really need those. And is your business model business to business business to consumer or like some other type? What kind of model business a business. Thank you so much. And can you just like give me a little bit of like background about yourself like your experience? So far with the your bio pastor  in terms of what like just how you've experienced like starting up this business, like how's the journey been? Um, well it's it's very different. My background is research. So I, I was in academia. So I mean, they are on the part of of the startup at the moment, but I am also CEO so I do look into like, you know, investments and possible clients. So it's been interesting, you know, to change the focus of instead of trying to do you know, an experiment that is going to give me the best yields now I have to look at things like is our costs gonna be okay? Or the raw materials I'm gonna use during the solvents are the reactants gonna be widely available? Are they gonna be like very hard to you know, like, like tweeters waste. So. So it's been, like, you know, doing many things that I was not. You know, that I didn't learn how to do so. So learning to golf, which is   That's great to hear. It's good to hear there. So I guess we can start now. That's all the questions I have, um, can you screen share again, the website and just, um, you can I'll give you like a minute just like scroll through the website. You don't have to like look deep into it. Just like Pretend I'm not here like scroll as you usually would. If you were like, please. Just take a minute, just a minute. Like, whatever you're thinking, tell me what you're thinking. Like, think out loud. If you're not I mean, like just, if anything interesting pops out, just like  okay. Um, like target customers is quite interesting. Because, you know, it's what they say that sometimes you have a product that no one wants to buy it before. Once you're interested interesting. This would be more for not B to B to B. Now, this is more for B to C and these two bays are normally less. Like you're on the represented,  let's say everything is always b2c products.  Okay. Okay. Interesting.  Things go all the way back to the top. We don't so now we're gonna go like section by section. So this is this this part that you're at right now. It's the top part. It's gonna it's an overview of what the company does. And I'm just like, read like the lines and like, tell me like, what, what your thoughts are like, the little, little quote right there. Like when you read it, like, what does the message mean to you? Does it stand out to you positively negatively?  Positively, like everything is  just the top.  They're just the first part there.   Yeah, maybe this picture I don't know if it says I looked weird actually. doesn't say anything.  But, um, the quote, a deeply understanding customer validation solution. Do those like stand out to you?  Um, no, not really. He's just, he's just okay.   And what do you think would me say like, stand out to you and more? Um, no, no, I think it's perfect. It's okay, like there's, it's, I can understand it. It's okay.  But like does it affect you positively or negatively? Like, what are your thoughts? Like, I want to hear like, more. Like, what's your reaction to it? Um,   and yeah, it's something that I want to do so it's, it makes me want to read more. So that's okay.  All right. And the, the 100% customer interviews, fully managed insights and skills do those pop out to and do they? Do they give you like more confidence in this website?  I'm only manage I don't really understand what it means. But I don't know if it's my non native English. speaking skills. Yeah. Yeah, that's totally fine. Insights scale also doesn't really say much. Maybe I'm thinking of B to B, and not B to C, but yet doesn't really say too much.  The next section the problem, so do the quotes. I'm wasting time burning cash, building the wrong products. Do those like what's your reaction to those and have you encountered these and can you share your experience?  Maybe not the wrong product but something like they're not ultimate product or something like that would be best in my opinion. Um, yeah, all of these sounds like problems. That startup stuff. So so does anything does anything like stand out to you?  Or not really, but it these these actually makes me want to like keep on scrolling? Because it's like, oh, we do have a question.  Yeah, so you're saying like this is like something that resonates with you. Next section that deeply understand your customer. Just take a read of that and like tell me what your thoughts are like what pops out to you what stands out? I think this could be a little bit clearer. Like on on the exact things that you could, like, how are you solving these problems for us? I know you're saying it, but I think it could be much more direct and like maybe even bullet points of what can you do?  So so far, what's like your understanding of this, like just just based on website  that you help startups understand their market, their target market. Also something really interesting would be like you know, reachable markets, and this kind of things. I like to convey that into into later on discussions with those potential customers. Totally interesting.   So, any more thoughts on that or we should move on to the session? We should move on just I need to be careful, be perfect.  Next section. So validate your solution with target customers. So just read that and like, let me know what stands out to you what resonates with you?  Um, this makes me like be a little bit doubtful because you like yeah, like you will have to understand really well. Like you know, the section of the market and the customers. So so so, like, if you do is well. Definitely could be interesting. Like the solution you're proposing. Um, do what well, like.  Like, I'm helping understand the, the market and how will our product would fit on it. Many small things to be considered so. So I would never like a third party to be in. You know, joining in, would be like, I don't know. It's a septic, let's say. So. So, at this point. We move on to the build traction with the early adopters. Once again, just read anything that stands out. Or just  For me, I just early adopters, it just means I'm not gonna read it because it's a b2c and b2b So like, in terms of, you know, I need to build up that pilot plant. And then we will have a sort of or the other, or maybe, you know, this in terms of its of, of letters of intent to purchase, or b2c is, I mean, b2b sale will be also interesting. Of course, that will be a much, much bigger pain, you know, for me to see, like getting all those letters of intent to purchase from well, feet. It's possible for customers because of the market section. So it'll be really interesting. Like there will be saying this for b2c.  Right. So, what you're saying is this doesn't resonate with you? Because you're Yeah, maybe  maybe you are saying the same. For me definitely does not resonate. It just says, it takes me to oh, this is not for me. This is for b2c. Yes.  Okay, got it. And in the social section, how do these testimonials or endorsements influenced your view of the website or product   um, I can only this one would be interesting. Maybe because of my what we do Yeah, and that's it. Only the which one did you say only the  HP paint  so nothing else? Nothing. Else like stands out in terms of  No, not really.  And could you explain why or just that you just never  like yeah, no. I don't know. I don't understand that if these are clients that you have. Or if this is like bigger so here social media, I don't know. So this is not clear to me. And doesn't really say anything.  So for our next session, what's your initial reaction to each of the advantages? So just go through one by one of them and they just tell me your reaction.  Well, in my mind, how do you manage what what of the entire project like the possible client clients, just like the market fit? Like, this could be a little bit clearer? Okay, not only that,  but can you do like each one because I know so expert led large partner teams like what's your reaction to those? Yeah.  Okay, understandable. Like okay, good things. Seem to be cooperating those things.  So are any Are any of these advantages important or valuable to you? And why would they be valuable to you?  Um, um, I don't know. I guess it depends on like, at this time, I don't really say anything. I will have to like, talk to someone to actually, you know, understand if you can help me with my with, with our B to C, I mean, b2b So yeah, like, it's good that you that you have someone like experts backing up the product. And and large themes but doesn't really like you know, I'm not sure it's gonna be useful. I don't really know anything could be applied at the moment.  So after, don't do the entire page, you know, just take another look around. Would you be inclined to this website like does this like, would this be something that you would like sign up for? Um, because your insight that positive and negative it's valuable.  Like, only because of a problem of this? I could consider it but the rest of the page doesn't really like you know, catches me completely. Only this section is like, Yeah, I do have those problems for bite here. I don't really know if you can help me solve them for not so  so do you have any like, what is that the part that's holding you back? Like what other reservations or like, doubts Do you have? Like,  I don't really understand properly, what the services could be. I'm like, what can you help me as a b2b or b2c? Yes. So I just, I would I would just say like, oh, this is not for me. Okay. And close it.      You said that on the other hand, you said that the problem section really stood out to do you think you'd be willing to just input your details  so now, so you want me to do it,  or if it's up to you, like if you're fine with it?  Well, yeah, just like um,  it's up to you, your choice.  So these needs, so this will be for some. I'm okay. Just for you. To like at some point. Tell me what.  What happens like if it's interesting. Okay, so what really made you like, want to input your data like what was the problem? The section the only thing that pushed you or was there anything else? Like, let's say, like, I wasn't here, would you think like what other stuff like snap to like  I don't put my details because I want to know, I kind of want to understand, but just because you're here and because we're doing this exercise? Not really because I would have done it. You know, I wouldn't have put in my details. Otherwise, but it is just that like a bit more clarity, clarity. If this could be a B to C or not, I mean, b2b And definitely, you know, like literally marrying each one of these problems with a solution that you provide. Like, you know, we help us do we have we have helped, I don't know how many, many customers or we have provide that. I don't know how many people for a team resulting in black or things like that, you know, bit more if you are really good. So if you married this to the solutions, I think that could be a really good idea.     Minh-Quan Tran   But so does anything else. Do you have any more thoughts? Anything? What do you want to say any questions? Only like, so this exercise exercises like this is you're trying to understand so you're trying to build a page or oh,  this is or this is just a research project. It's not.  Yeah, but like I research on what I like research, so I just want to understand. So  once again, I'm part of an externship. Yes. So we're there we're just building a website. And we're seeing like, we want some expert opinions on product market fit, and how this website can have like your feedback on this website would just be helpful for us to develop it.  Okay, so we'll get better. Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay,  so you don't have any more thoughts? Nothing? No. So thank you so much for your insights and feedback. This has been immensely valuable, and I truly, truly appreciate your time. This really helps me and extra ship I'm in and if you don't have anything else regarding it together, thank you. So much.

Oh, wow, this is really good website.  Awesome. Okay. So, um, if you could, like, share, um, yeah, if you could share your screen that'd be cool. If I could just like see you like walking through the site.  Oh, okay. Sounds good. Oh, so I'm disabled to share.  I'm sorry, let me see if I can change are you able to now?  Yeah, I think awesome. So very excited for X turn.  Okay. Yeah. So you can just like walk, you can just like run through it and skim through it and then I'll just have like some questions for you. But basically this is like an overview of what the company does. So please, like I said, take a moment to read through it. You can share your thoughts out loud. Yeah, just like line by line. Whatever you feel is best. So yeah, go for it good.  So we can just start at the first part like the like the top part like the summary, like basically at the top part of the accelerate product market fit part. So some questions I have for you like, are just like what are your overall thoughts so far? Like maybe like, what's your overall impression of this message? What kind of thing what kind of things are you taking away from it? And is there anything that's standing out to you right now? Positive or negative?  Oh, well, I have a question. Yes, definitely. So it's just like the, like a company that provides like how to find like a market fit and business model to like a startup.  Essentially, yes, it is like that. So it tests your business models like it says, and it's just launching an externship to extend your runway if you will. So if you finding like this to be vague, then definitely I'd love to hear your thoughts on it and maybe like some if you have like some negative positive thoughts, like does this message resonate you with anyway? Or can you like, are you facing any challenges just from this first part, like if you are can you elaborate like like you said, like, you're a little bit confused on the overall message right now.  Yes, so right now I haven't read everything. So I really do I have to like judge like based on the first part, like instead of getting every everything like just here Yeah,  so you can just like we can just like judge what you're thinking right now and then we can move on to like the problem section and go from there. So right now like I guess what are your first impressions and what are you taking away just from this over Overview section? Okay. Oh, so right now, like without reading the problem statement, it is a little difficult to identify like, who's the your actual customer of this company? Because it says like, oh deeply understand your customers. So like, whether it's like already developed company, or is it like a startup, that part I can really see it from this part. And it says like the product market fit. So test your business model, but like, it's like, um, it's because I haven't read the What's the solution? This? Exactly. Okay. Okay, sure. Like which part? And also like, what is actually like me like externship at this moment, I just want to more explaining each of them.  Gotcha. So, like, yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry. Oh, yeah, go ahead. Yeah, I was just gonna say like, so you're just like facing lots of like clarity issues right now. Yeah. Okay, gotcha. Um, cool. So like next we can move over to the problems section. So, this is a section that discusses some problems that people might be facing. So you can just go ahead and read through that. And then while you're just like, looking through that, I can ask you like, how do these phrases such as like the wasting time burning cash, all of these like how do these phrases resonate with you? And have you encountered any of these problems?  Okay, sounds good. Okay, so first part, like when I see the problem statement, I think there's a lot of like, probably been mentioned that like the one specific problem, let's say 90% ups are to fail. So that's like the one problem maybe that could be a result of those things. Like you have limited resources till the end. But like, it's hard for me to identify what kind of problem you're trying to solve or you're trying to solve that, like, Oh, your list of products are endless. This is the problem you're trying to solve. So it's hard to imagine. Like, because I when I first saw the description, it's like, oh, how to find a market fit. Then I feel like the problem is they men should be Oh, like 90 of like percent of the startups are having difficulties of validating their business model, something like that. Clear to understand that, like, how's it going to be look like if I solve this problem, but this problem statement I it's a little hard to guidance by.  Okay, that makes sense. So just like for your personal startup, I've like I'm curious, like, have you encountered any of these problems that they like, say that they're like listing?  Yeah, I feel like we're facing right now. Indicate the problem statement. Um, so this is what we've heard from many like started with vice versa, you have to choose one problem statement. And then like, you have to communicate that with the, like investors. So like, just having one problem that directly related to the solution that you're going to probably like provide it has to be very clear. Okay.     Gotcha. Thank you for that. Yeah, that's a very good that it's like in this interesting like, learning your experiences from it from your personal startup. So yeah, it's just it's still right now. It's a bit like unclear to you like how the problem really resonates with the overall message that we were discussing, or prior Gotcha. So as you scroll down, this is like the Features section. So for each feature, there's like different features that is listed for instance, like they're deeply understanding your target customer, or validating the solution. With the target customers. And if you scroll down more, it's like building traction with early adopters. So you can just read through that right now. I'll give you a minute. And then once you're done with that, I have some questions.  Okay. Sounds good.  Just let me know when you're ready.  Okay.  Okay, I think I'm ready.  Okay, awesome. So thank you for that. And so after you've like, looked over the different features, so we can like start one by one. So for the first one, deeply understanding your target customer, What's your understanding of this feature? And like, does this appeal to you like what appeals to you about this feature? And if it doesn't, like, why, why does it not appeal to you? And like, based on the website right now, like what's your impression or understanding of like what's been given to you for this specific feature?  So this will give some more of like, research platform that like so most of the companies like startups are doing like a user research like what what is their target market, but this company is like doing that for the company with the expert piece on like research. So this one is like you I don't know how it actually works. Maybe there could be a little bit of problem. So there's like a target customer, this company will find out and then they'll going to interview and provide the insight to the startup, is that correct?  Yeah. Okay. So I would love to just like know your thoughts like there's no clear right or wrong answer is just like basically I'm trying to gain like what you're trying to you're receiving from this so yeah, thank you for that. So um, gotcha. So from this it from this like first feature you're, it's put to you it's looking like they're trying to find like some research to help this product market fit. For the startups.  Yeah. So they're like conducting the research. corrida, startups, okay. Gotcha, that makes sense. And then we can move on to the second feature. So validating your solution with target customers. Again, I have the same questions like What's what is your understanding of this feature like from what you've read? What are you understanding from this and does this appeal to you or does it not like what appeals to you about this feature or what doesn't?  Okay, oh, what appeals to me about this ideas like it validates your solution with every customer. So like is it isn't like, just an idea or like, will there be like the MVP already ready for startups? So like, has the MVP already developed? And then this company has tried to like give the MVP to the customer to test it out? Or what is this actually about? Maybe that's a question that I have. Okay.     So go ahead. Sorry.  No, I was just gonna say so do you think like, that's again, like something that's a little unappealing is you really don't really know what your what kind of benefit you're getting from this. Like what?  Yeah, okay. Oh, so that's what kind of what I want to know. Like, is it like validating the idea like the solution or is it actually validating the MVP and give it to the customer and hey, it's this is like product like, what do you think? Is it that kind of approach? Those things I'm not very clear.  So yeah, from this, my takeaway is that is just making sure that whatever solution you as a startup you're trying to try to like give to your customers. We're making sure that the solution actually resonates with the customer. And it's actually like a painkiller that way it actually is a pain reliever and it actually is helping the customer. So the product is validated and it's working with your target audience that whatever that may be. Yeah. Okay. Awesome. Thank you. So we can move on to the last feature now, which was the building traction with your early adopters so what was your understanding of this feature?     Unknown Speaker 14:09   This feature     Speaker 2 14:20   so it looks like it's helping the company acquiring the early adopter, like the first like few, like customer who were using this product at the beginning stage. I liked the idea, but I feel like it's a little different from the characteristic of the most like different two part because I those two parts are more of like the research and then like trying to find the market fit. But the third part is more of like the marketing. They're like, Oh, we find a customer for you. So I feel like those are like kind of two different characteristic in here.     Speaker 1 14:58   Makes sense? So based on this website, like right now, like from what your from what everything you've just saw, what's your overall impression or understanding of the website right now? Like what are you thinking and like, what are your impressions?     Speaker 2 15:15   Oh, okay. So the impression that I got was I, since I understand, just like the idea of here, but like those things like how it's going to actually help the startup to grow those parts. I was, it was hard for me to understand. Like what kind of I know the feature that is being provided by how actually isn't going to be held? So it's hard to like, imagine my brain, okay, when I use this product, this process will be like this. Those thing, it's a little hard for me to imagine.     Speaker 1 15:48   Okay, that makes perfect sense. Cool. So thank you again, and we're gonna move down now to if you like, scroll down Yeah. And you see some of like, the testimonials like you see, like there's like Snapchat on there and like HP, some other like some companies. So how do these like testimonials or endorsements influence your view of the product now?     Speaker 2 16:13   Oh, definitely. Because I see those like, you know, famous companies here. It makes me like trust. You know, give me more trust. Oh, yeah, this company already used it. So it makes me more like trust on it. Okay. Yeah, but I saw a lot of website using this thing. So yeah, I think he's pretty good.     Speaker 1 16:33   Okay, cool. And then we'll move on to the advantages. So, again, you can just take your time reading the advantages first, and then you can like share any thoughts you have with me while if you're like thinking about anything and if not, I can ask you some questions.     Speaker 2 17:40   Okay, I feel like this part is like, pretty, to be honest, I liked this part compared to the previous like part. As far as I can just still I'm not very clear about what externship will be looked like. But still I can see oh, there's a good one in this row leader. Who's gonna lead the project and then they'll be like go 100 People person team will be like helping out with the product to like validate the idea. I feel like this advantage is part to be more elaborated and goes to this like solution part. I think the solution part can be more like elaborated like this kind of like format. Okay, so     Speaker 1 18:20   do you think do you think it would have been better if you learn about the advantages like before the features that we looked at before? Yeah,     Speaker 2 18:27   advantages could be like the competitive advantage as well. Yeah, like, there's one let's say because I you know, I'm used to more of like the Fitch leg so I kind of like just this by the pictures like that I've made exactly yeah. But like I didn't know about like the website part because looks that part could be like very simplified because like maybe like this customer already know. What is going to be looked like. But if this like afford a website for the people who never knew about the product, I think it should be like more elaborated on the process, and what kind of results they can get. And then also like, if this is like a testimonial, maybe you can elaborate more on to like what kind of return they got like after they use this product.     Speaker 1 19:16   Okay, thank you. So, just looking at the advantages still for the first advantage that like the fully managed advantage, what was your like initial reaction to this and like, is this something that's like important or valuable to you as like a startup founder?     Speaker 2 19:42   fully managed I think yeah, I think it's good. It's just like, I don't know it's hard for me to imagine like how this is going to fully manage okay.     Speaker 2 20:01   So I feel like will be great. If the expert partly expertise, like what kind of people who are going to be leading this project? If those kinds of things mentioned I feel like I'll be more trustful, let's say because I'm making like a social media with my friends of the person who's doing the market research is from let's say, meta or some kind of like social media platform that I feel like it's going to be really stressful because we want to validate our product too. So those are like it's a good idea, but I think it's just a way to explain things how it's gonna look because if it like elaborate more, will be easier for those startup people to be convinced. So I think it should be more convincing for them or why they have to use this product like product especially.     Speaker 1 20:49   Okay, that makes sense. So, from these advantages, like the three advantages like the that they list, like the fully managed expert led large project teams which ones do you think are like most valuable to you and why?     Speaker 2 21:04   Oh, it should be like our industry veterans will get the critical insight for your company needs. Because like there's companies like same for us. It's hard to find like the right advisor to see like if this product is going to be worked or not. So I think those industry veterans are really appealing as long as like they're really certified and verified people.     Speaker 1 21:29   Okay, gotcha. Thank you so much. Um, so after going through this entire page, how would you feel about taking the next step like, you see how the button it says like, get started, that's kind of like the call to action. So would you be inclined to get started and if yes, would you be like willing to input your details and if not, what can you share? Like what's holding you back or any like reservations you have?     Unknown Speaker 22:01   After I     Speaker 1 22:03   Yeah, so so go ahead. You can take time to read through it and then we can go back to the questions.     Speaker 2 22:27   This was like sparked me a curiosity like, oh, what kind of like better as needed, but since like, there's like a no portfolio of or let's say, I see the external like clients here as like the snapshots. But I don't really know much about like, what company has actually done for these company. I'll be like a little hesitant and then like, as you can see, those companies are like, already developed a company like Snapchat, or I'm not quite sure about those companies, but it looks like is it tech venture is it like yeah,     Speaker 1 23:06   HPCL so like, they make like different like laptops and stuff. So they're also really high up their company for sure.     Speaker 2 23:13   Yeah, so like, this client solace, kind of, for me if I like if I'm like already develop and then I have a really good you know, level of company might be interested in. But if I'm like, let's say a very early startup that trying to find a target market like then I'm pretty sure these like startup will be like pretty early stage because they they're still struggling for finding their markets. And then if I see the East company, maybe it will be a little hard for me to relate myself of like, oh, how this company would help early stage startup. Because I there's no portfolio been ready. Or this company has done any like proof. I might be a little hesitant to.     Speaker 1 23:58   Okay, that makes sense. Yeah. So you just so in summary, like you need you just feel like you need more information as like an early stage startup to know like if this if this like company will really help you with what they say like what, how to like help you be a successful startup. With that, like product market fit.     Unknown Speaker 24:18   Yes.     Speaker 1 24:19   Okay. Awesome. Well, thank you so much for your insights and feedback. I think that wraps it up. I really appreciated learning your like insights and how you would go about it as a startup founder. So thank you again, this has been really valuable.

It's for I will be sharing my journey for validating the product. For example, I started with market research to get the problem. So after that, after getting the problem, I'm trying to map in the solution to solve that problem. And the next stage is, after getting the solution, I will be trying to find if the product is market fit or not. So this solution, there are users who want to buy it or not. And after that, I'm starting to build in my MVP. So when I say validate your solution and after that, that's your business model, which is mean. market validation, and after that your product market fit. So it seems the same as my process. When I'm trying to validate my solution.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  7:13    Okay, okay. That means that this message resonates with exactly what you're experiencing.     Zakaria Chamakh  7:21    Yeah, yeah. Okay. Cool. Okay, maybe you should change this call to action to like, get a demo. It will be I don't know in my opinion, it will be good. Okay,     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  7:40    so in the absence of the bottom of get a demo, how does it make you feel about the product?     Zakaria Chamakh  7:50    Yeah. So so so I will be like the demo for this, this the service. So what you've seen right now it's service help is founders. To validate their product at this correct. Okay. So when will you be giving me a demo? So I can see the business model how you give me the business model, the validation stage, and all of the comments that you will give me so that will be very helpful for me.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  8:27    Okay, so are these three points? What insights gave you?     Zakaria Chamakh  8:36    Can you repeat the question, please? I don't hear     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  8:38    the plus 100 customer interview.     Zakaria Chamakh  8:43    The social proof. Okay, so, maybe, I don't know. I don’t feel comfortable with that. Maybe you can add avatars like the small images of people and add another way for the social proof. It's like spammy here. For me, it's like 100 customer interviews following managers and insights at scale. It's like, I don't know. I don't like them. It seemed like a spammer. So maybe if you add the avatar of people, it's make it more human. And if you got me on that,     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  9:24    what do you mean by avatar ?     Zakaria Chamakh  9:28    You add the images for people's okay, you add that is another type of social proof. So you can add the avatar of people like that, stuck on them vertically. And also you can add some headlines like 100 customer interviews and, for example, and then 100 found the help or something like that. Okay,     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  9:59    okay, perfect. Can you jump to the next section, please?     Zakaria Chamakh  10:04    Also, I don't know. It's not semantic one, this this image     to be honest, I don't find that semantic. It does not give me a meaning for this section. Okay, I think you should change. Okay.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  10:25    So when you see the problem. What do you think What's your first impression about?     Zakaria Chamakh  10:33    Oh, give me one minute. How will we get the problem sorted First Data fill has limited resources, your team understands that you're doing work. You've never done your list of projects in lists, and you need help. Okay, So stop wasting time, brain in bash, and building the wrong products. Yeah, I find this perfect, to be honest. So this problem statement is like describing my situation. So I find that perfect Yeah. I don't have anything to say here. Okay, you mute your mic. Okay. So     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  11:32    here, like these points, wasting time burning cash building the wrong product. But what's the problem that resonates with you more?     Zakaria Chamakh  11:45    What I find more important is not wasting time. So you're wasting time for sure. And you get experience with that. burning cash. It's normal. You're starting a business. So building the wrong product is a big problem for me. So when you, like go in the wrong path your system for validation. The product is wrong. So you've come up with the wrong wrong product. So that's so important for me. Okay, if I so if you ask me to choose one I only choose the building with the wrong product.         Kawtar Ait oulahyani  12:00  Okay. Perfect. Okay, so let's go to the next section      Zakaria Chamakh 12:30  deeply understand your target customer. Yeah, that's a big one on so when you're trying to build in products after, I don't know, as I see it. So you should not separate them like you should find a problem and the same time focus on the customer challenge target customer, so you should create a user persona. So this problem whose people that pain with this problem when you will be building these products, you will be addressed them so this is so important. How alone, you don't want the customer Okay, good question. I want the most server pains. Okay. Sign how much? Okay, I don't know. Maybe you can change this question. The Paragraph form way to make it like a list to make it more visible. And also, maybe make it involved. So it's less important than the headline for sure. But it's always important, so maybe it's smaller and also you should make it bold. So fine customer interview winter. Slash product market fit, extend an hour our team will interview to target customers and give you a certain need. Okay, so you're offering the service also. Helping, the founders with their customers so you're creating their user persona also and you reaching out to them and interviewing them?      Kawtar Ait oulahyani  14:48    what do you think based on what you’ve read?     Zakaria Chamakh  14:54    Yeah, that's what I'm understanding. Okay.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  14:58    Okay. As you said, you said we help you understand your target by conducting interviews how does this make you feel about the product?     Zakaria Chamakh  15:19    Yeah, this will be more helpful for us as a foreigner so I will be delegated the hard one-have stages, creating a user persona and creating a target market so a target customer so yeah, it will be I will be paid for the service. For sure.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  15:42    So can we jump to the next section, please? Okay,     Zakaria Chamakh  15:45    Okay. Does your solution resonate with your customer? Maybe you should change the order of this section. Maybe I don't know what I find logic is to validate your solution with the target customer and after that, if we define the target customer after that we will be interviewed and that's what I find that so should put them here and change switch them. Does your solution reason with your customer as I already building the products is expensive . Protect your runway  by launching Product Market Fit externship  We'll run validation experiments with your target audience to increase your chances of success. Yeah, for hundreds you should switch these two sections.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  17:01    Okay. Is there something that didn't make sense to you or doesn't align with what you're experiencing?      Zakaria Chamakh  17:11    What I find that logic is that first you should define your target customer and you're trying to validate the solution with them. So, what I find it logic you should validate the solution and after that, so in the validation process, you will be interviewed and I give you the feedback for switching sections. Okay. Okay, I will be go to the next section. Build trust with your early adopter.. Okay. So, so, we're good. We go to the next stage. So we have the validation for the product market, and we were talking right now in the early adopter. So people that will pay us for their our services. Okay. How many early adopter customers? What’s the acquisition channel the most effective? Same feedback you should make it in order plus will be more visible. And for the question like you really put your finger in the pain points in the center one . So the acquisition channels for example, for my experience, like technical founders, really, we have difficulty with the acquisition channels.   Yeah. So it's also I have other feedback you should maybe replace the images with meaningful one.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  19:31    okay. So for this section, how does it make you feel about the product?     Zakaria Chamakh  19:42    So you add in this logos, like your partner or something like that, so you're working with them or something like that.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  19:53    Okay. If we worked with these partners, does it influence your point of view about the product?     Zakaria Chamakh  20:04    Yeah, 100%  we have the Hp Tech Ventures and the snapshot at the company so 100%      Okay, so for our advantage fully managed and we managed the entire project and with minimal time commitment needed from you. Okay, what's like? like as a founder, you're trying to find the problem, have validated, find the solution find whether it is a market fit or not? Find that the customer outreach then also develop the solution like trying to develop the MVP, so you're trying to do a lot of things at the same time. So if I had this chance to delegate some of my process would be those four, four, for sure. expertise or our industry venture will be critical in search of your company's needs. Okay, okay. The large project team will self-expand with one person team, our team means more results faster and better. Okay.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  21:22    Okay, so from these advantages? Which one that resonates with you more     Zakaria Chamakh  21:32    All of them.  But what if I say it's so important is fully monitored? So, really, the, I will delegate the work for you and you will be manage of my hands or like, I will be getting feedback and trying to achieve my goals. Yeah, this is so important. Maybe I can get some expert in LinkedIn or something like that or other founder communities. I don't know. It's not important as fully managed. Also, for the last project teams, maybe I can delegate the work to a freelancer or something like that. But if you are, you have automated work and I will view the whole process and I will be delegated the task that I want to achieve. And you will be doing it for me. Yeah, that will help me a lot.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  22:45    Okay. What do you think about the logo? It is in another section. Sorry, can you move it?     Zakaria Chamakh  22:54    Okay. So using the IA of the units in the avatars of your team, okay, so this real one,     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  23:08    okay, like, which feedback does this give you?     Zakaria Chamakh  23:14    Oh, no, it's new for me.     To be honest, it's sweet. Me, I don't know, to see in some of our generics about AI. It's not like you see  real people. Also, maybe you should add Twitter LinkedIn or some social media for this team for here like Mike, engineering, or working with you. So maybe you can add the link so to make the trust between us,     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  24:06    okay, so in the presence of real faces of the team that works with external like that impact your point of view of the products?     Zakaria Chamakh  24:21    Not a lot, but yeah, for sure. Okay.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  24:30    About the logo.     Zakaria Chamakh  24:33    I will be trying to open Okay, so this person is not clickable. Oh, you don't have social media or something like that. So you should add it  100% You should add. Okay. Okay for the logo. It's simple. Yeah, I find it nice.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  24:57    Okay, so now you checked all the website, what do you think could be a good tagline?     Zakaria Chamakh  25:07    tagline. Yeah. You mean the tagline with the hero. Section? I think. Yeah, I'm selecting right now.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  25:16    No, like the slogan.     Zakaria Chamakh  25:20    Oh, okay. I don't know if you need it maybe I only think it's not important.     Zakaria Chamakh  25:35    to plot it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  25:39    Okay, perfect. So now that you've checked all the sections what do you want to do next? Would you jump to get started?     Zakaria Chamakh  25:48    Yeah, if you give me a demo, or discount for sure, how will we try it? I would like for sure if I right now. Getting this interview so I get to try this product for sure. I have interest in this product. So if you had developed this product, I would like to reach out me and I will get right.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  26:16    Okay, so you told me that if  if the bottom is about to get a new demo than you will click on it.      Zakaria Chamakh  26:31    like so I'm trying to get a demo for for the product market fit so I can see the profit.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  26:38    Okay, you see, when you for example you you found this website and you want to check what's the products about and you see the bottom get started so you won't click on it     Zakaria Chamakh  26:52    not I won't click but if I will be what I mean unmake it what I was I find it more meaningful. It's getting demo not I get it start with the process.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  27:12    So this section just to know more feedback. About the distinction of get started.     Zakaria Chamakh  27:20    Okay. So, okay, it's clickable. Yeah. So stick with one of our expert. Okay discovered covering. Our team externs help. Company though managed for remote team extract. My question will matter of the weeks that you can search for our products markets. Okay. So same headlines there. So I should fill out this form or something like that.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  28:04    If you wants to. So does this mean that you like when you fill in your information means that you want to be contacted by the team?      Zakaria Chamakh  28:20    I accepted to get this interview so accepted to get contacted     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  28:31    that you have other questions that you that need their answer.     Zakaria Chamakh  28:38    I don't know. I don't think so. Nothing came to my mind right now. To my mind that now. So     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  28:49    I'm like after you check all the websites. So like, Was it easy for you to find what you were looking for?     Zakaria Chamakh  29:07    Yeah     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  29:11    Okay, and how would you describe your overall experience? With the website     Zakaria Chamakh  29:23    I'm trying to thinking for helpful feedbacks. I don’t want to  give you generalone.  So my full experience with this website is smooth Yeah. It's like i’m familiar with the same structure with landing page,  the hero section, the features and the call action in the bottom so it’s good user experience. Maybe I give you feedback about the images that are not semantic, they don't add in meaningful information to these headlines and descriptions.    ", Partially resonated ," All of them.  But what if I say it's so important is fully monitored.  But if you have automated work and I will view the whole process and I will be delegated the task that I want to achieve. And you will be doing it for me. Yeah, that will help me a lot. ",," This value proposition maybe you can improved it by adding some keywords like product fit or product market fit, or something like that.  So for example, we help products we help founders in the process of Product Market Fit. The process that you're using it seems the same as my process. When I'm trying to validate my solution. For the value proposition : It seemed like a spammer. So maybe if you add the avatar of people, it's make it more human. ",,"  So building the wrong product is a big problem for me. So when you, like go in the wrong path your system for validation. The product is wrong. So you've come up with the wrong wrong product. So that's so important for me.

Christina Maroun 0:03   Yeah, sounds good. If there's any point where you have questions or you want me to stop recording, just let me know. Hey, I'm gonna share the link to the mock mock website in the chat.     You got it. Okay, nice if you're able to share your screen, yep     Cool. Yep. Yeah, I see it. Awesome. So, as you explore the website, I would like you to share your honest thoughts out loud. After you complete the walkthrough. I'll ask you some follow up questions. Okay, cool.     Interviewee 1:09   Okay, the, like, man here like the, I guess CTA here. I I don't really know what it means right now. I'm like, so a lot of things could accelerate product market fit     so I don't know that maybe there's a way that that can be more straightforward of like what you actually do. And then understanding customer launch a product market fit externship? I don't know what that is. I'm like hoping to learn by what that means. But immediately I'm thinking like, Okay, does it I wonder if it like, that's actually something that could be the big text like launch a product market fit externship? And then you could like give details payment. That's just my initial thoughts there. customer interviews fully managed. Okay. My Resources Yes.     Understand your target customer. Our team will walk 50 targeted customers will interview okay Okay, so I'm immediately I'm starting to think that like, there's still no externship as what I'm like, You're gonna, you're gonna take my product and you're gonna go interview 50 People without me having to do it. And see what they think about it. Just I mean, this is me my personal opinion when it comes to websites. I like I'm not in love with every single image being just like a stock image. I think there's like, you can do like some illustrations or some other things to make me feel like more welcome. I think if I just saw like a bunch of stock photos I like maybe start devaluing how valuable the product would be even though like maybe amazing. Okay, build a solutions with current customers. paint color. Okay, so you're running validation experiments. Gold traction     Okay. Okay. I mean, that attractive client list so that's positive. I like the social proof angle. If this is like, I would maybe want to make this even, like bigger than just one line because that like, if that's legit, that's like actually a very interesting advantage to fully managed. expert led large project teams 100 person teams. Okay, I would immediately think like, how are you guys actually doing that? Is it like coming from the Philippines or something for necessarily a big deal but okay. These people look like I was saying they are. Okay, cool. Cool. All right. So I'm gonna do also, like, I don't I see. It's like x turn.ai. I don't see anything that's like, AI in here. It's always like a quick question mark. For me. It looks like kind of just like a service business where you're using like a staff of people to help me do things. I don't really see where like they I think comes in. But I'm also just like, fairly skeptical of AI businesses or businesses that have AI in the name if they don't actually have aI Okay. Cool. Yeah,     okay. Cool. That sounds like a little weird since I already did it before. Not a huge deal     Christina Maroun 6:25   um, yeah, pretty much you completed the block for you. I'm just going to ask you some follow up questions. Yeah. Oh, could you still share the Yes. Yeah.     Interviewee 6:40   Gemini go back to like, just the other page.     Christina Maroun 6:48   I guess just the homepage. Yep. Okay.     Interviewee 6:56   Sharing that are now sharing the one share. Last I shared one tab instead of the window.     Christina Maroun 7:07   I'm just gonna look through the questions. Um so I guess I just starting off here. Is there anything that like stands out to you either positively or negatively. I'm just looking at this message. Yeah,     Interviewee 7:30   I mean, so launch and Product Market Fit externship? Like, makes me like, sparks my curiosity because I have no idea what it means. And it sounds like Oh, have you do you guys have you guys developed like a new thing to like test product market? Fit? If so, that's like kind of interesting to me. And then I want to like know more about it. The understanding of customer validate your solution, build traction, test, your business model, extend your runway, all those things like are just kind of fluff to me. I don't really, of course, I every single thing I do in my business is associated with doing all those things. So I don't really get any value from a lot of those sentences. Whereas like, launch up to me. Again, I don't know what to externship is. But like, if the topic, launch a product market fit externship as like that's your one line pitch. And then under that in the little like, subtitle you give me what a product market fit externship was. I think that would probably be way more valuable but like a lot of those things because when I see like a product market fit deeply understand your customer value solution, build traction, test, your business model, extend the runway, I just kind of skipped over all those things.     Christina Maroun 8:56   Okay, I'm just gonna keep scrolling through the questions. Yeah. I'm up. If you scroll down to where it's the problem, yep. Are there any like those phrases wasting time burning cash building the wrong product? Do any of those phrases like resonate with you?     Interviewee 9:20   I would say build it in the wrong products. Probably the biggest one though, yeah, because I think like to me, I want like the focus at this stage is to hit product market fit and to me Product Market Fit means you have the right product for the right people. burning cash like I'm going to do regardless like I'm like I have to run my business like so we're going to spend money trying to explore but building your own product is like the thing that's top of mind for me.     Christina Maroun 10:11   So if you scroll down a little bit more, yep. Um, I just like looking at this feature right here. What is your understanding of this feature?     Interviewee 10:26   Yeah, so I think you're gonna basically take my product Maybe it's like a figma walkthrough or web flow walkthrough like this, and you're gonna take it to 50 people and see if they resonate so like basically user testing or user interviews with my product.     Christina Maroun 10:51   Um Okay, I'm just gonna keep asking more questions. Okay. Yeah, just continue to scroll down. I guess with the next these next two features. Like, was there anything that like stood out? Like, you know, either positive or negative, like any anything that like resonated with you with these two features?     Interviewee 11:19   Yeah, I think I would want to know what, find validation experience. So again, with this one, with this, basically all of these wait until like the very last sentence to say what you're actually going to do. Like, to me I would want that to be first because I'm basically skimming all this stuff. And then I'm hitting this last sentence. And I'm like, okay, so you're gonna run validation experiments with my target audience. Cool. So you're like interviewing 50 people, you're gonna run some experiments with them to see like, if they actually resonate with the product at all. And then you're gonna launch this externship to start acquiring people. So like, that's where I'm getting the values in these lessons is that's what jumped out at me. The other like the questions kind of the like, you have like many different questions. Those things like it could be one like literally one question I want to answer instead of like, three questions, like, two kind of descriptors and then finally, the solution. Like I always just want to know the solution quicker because I'm gonna skim a lot of stuff pretty quick     Christina Maroun 12:44   could you scroll down to the our advantage section     Interviewee 12:47   Yes.     Christina Maroun 12:51   I guess like the same thing here. Like, what stood out to you with these features     Interviewee 13:01   that stood out was the 100 person teams. I was like, Oh, that's interesting. At one I wonder how much this is gonna cost. I immediately was like, oh, man, do I need a lot of money to be able to do this? Because 100 people seems like a lot. And then I was like, oh, maybe it's like offshoring or something. So very curious what that means. But that definitely stood out. Yeah, I mean, that was the biggest one. The first two. I think like, not Yeah, it doesn't jump out as much to me expert lead makes me think like who or who's your team and then seeing the AI people like no credentials. I think like, I would obviously want to know what if the team is experts like if you're interested veterans, like I would want to know, like what they did before?     Christina Maroun 13:56   Um, yeah, that's pretty much all the questions. Thank you so much for your feedback and time. Do you have any other overall thoughts feedback or recommendations after looking through the website     Interviewee 14:12   was an externship? What is it?     Christina Maroun 14:16   Um, okay, before I answer that, um, what do you think like, What's your theory?     Interviewee 14:23   I mean, I was thinking that like maybe, so. I don't know maybe you're going for like people who are in college or something who need like experience experience and then you're taking like, a bunch of them and making them starting to do user interviews for me. Is that what it is?     Christina Maroun 14:46   Yeah, like pretty, pretty much. Um, so like compared to internship. externship. It tends to be a little bit more accessible and flexible. And it's usually more like shorter and structured. Those are like, it's similar to internship, but it's like those differences.     Interviewee 15:11   It sounds interesting, though. Like, basically you're saying hey, I have a problem. Where like, maybe my product manager or something can only ask so many questions or like talk to so many customers. Like if you get a bunch of people, so are you are the people you're hiring for the externship students, or are they like, just random people who want like a short term kind of gig?     Christina Maroun 15:38   Um, the aim is towards students and recent graduates.     Interviewee 15:46   Okay, and then you're paying them. Are you Is it like a four experience kind of thing?     Christina Maroun 15:56   It depends on the externship? Yeah.     Interviewee 16:01   Yeah, I mean, because that's just so. Okay. Understanding that like, I feel like you could be super upfront with what exactly you're offering as opposed to like, yeah, that would be the that would be my thing. Because if I come if I came in here, like I think the idea is really interesting. I've thought about this a bunch of like, Could I basically leverage people who want experience, you know, what, like to get in the space to help me like, build, build a company, whether that's, you know, technically or like product related like this? I think in describing that very, very clearly up front would be like, way more helpful. So as an example, if I see this like hero launch, once a product market fit externship is like a super interesting Catch, catch line because I'm like, Okay, I'm looking for product market fit. Maybe I do want to launch an externship. I just need to figure out what this means. And then underneath that you say, like, leverage the brightest, you know, college minds to, I don't know, talk to your customers at scale or something like things that make it very clear that okay, like it's a college, basically, college students that are helping out, getting user interviews done and testing, like doing some validation testing. That would be like, if I see that in the hero, and then the pictures on the right side is like, maybe some college students or something or like, you know something that also makes me think of like, okay, this is people who are students or recent grads who are going to be helping me with this thing, like matching kind of that image and with like, the, the text would be super interesting to me, because then I would definitely want to scroll down. I think like, getting into more detail around. I don't think the problem sector necessarily needed to be honest, because as a founder, I know, like what my problem is, and I know that I need to have customer validation. I don't think you really need to, like sell that to me, maybe for like a VC pitch deck. You wouldn't want to sell that but to me, I don't really think I need it. And then this if you just said deeply understand your customer wants your product market. Fit externship, and our team will interview 50 Plus target customers and give me the certainty you need. Like, great. Okay, awesome. So I know now you're going to interview people. And then validate your solution with our customers will run about will run valid validation experience experiments with your target audience, you increase your chances of success, like even if you just have those two sentences and the same year, build traction, launch this and begin acquiring early customers or like maybe like we will we'll help you get your first 100 customers or something. Just what you're going to do at a high level and then exactly how you're going to do that. If you just had those, I think it would be like really compelling. Because I would at least want to know more because it's like, Hey, you're gonna help me interview people. You're gonna do validation experience experiments, you're gonna get me my first 100 users. And maybe at least specially for me who is like, targeting college students and recent grads, like even just from like, Hey, you can get me my first 100 users and my target demographic would be awesome. The next thing that I would immediately want to know is how much it costs. Because I'm sure you've seen like usertesting.com or user interviews, and that it's so friggin expensive to use those platforms. And a lot of the times, like, I don't really care if it's, you know, somebody who was an ex Product Manager at Uber or whatever, I would much rather just have it be like a random person, which like a college student would be totally fine for me. And so like I would want to know, okay, I'm assuming it's cheaper because an internship is cheaper like externship, I guess is cheaper than if I were to just pay somebody to do this, but I would want to know pricing pretty quickly then. So like, even down here, where it's like our advantage, just put pricing. Like, I don't even need to know your advantage because I think realistically if you're getting college students who do this like, I don't, I don't know if like expert lead or whatever. It really matters. It's like, hey, we just have humans are gonna be able to help you and give you feedback and interview people like all this stuff. But just tell me like exactly what it costs and then I think it'd be like very interesting to me. Now it's a lot but     Christina Maroun 20:51   um, your feedbacks really good. Do you have any more questions or any last thoughts? You have an issue?     Interviewee 21:02   Is this like, Have you started working with any like college students on this yet? Or like people actually doing or are you just testing kind of the business idea?     Christina Maroun 21:14   So so in this particular case, for this mock website, it's just testing the business idea. Yeah. There are externships you know, like other stuff, but like this specifically, the mock website and the product that's being advertised it's in testing. Yeah,     Interviewee 21:36   I mean, I think you can pretty easily. I mean, one one other thing that I was just thinking of is for me, it would be amazing like if I had so we live in Austin, like, if there was one student who was like doing an externship, or something at UT, and could just interview like 50 of their classmates or something for me and test like our product or try to convince like, basically, see if they can get the first like 100 people in their school to sign up for our platform. Like that would be super valuable to me, because I think that the tough thing for us, like we were targeting people, between the ages of like 18 and 27 Probably, and it was really hard for us to get like our first 100 users. And I think like young people and like college students are often early adopters of things and so even if it's not like, Hey, you go hire this college student to then go interview like 50 other people, even if it was like you just have like a docket of like a bunch of college students who want to give product feedback themselves like it doesn't even have to be like a full externship program. But even if you just had that roster of people that you could pay like a couple of bucks each time they give some sort of feedback. I think that could be really compelling to like, if I take 10 minutes of my time to give you feedback on your app. Then I get like, free Starbucks or something. I don't know. It'd be valuable enough for me to say like if I can pay you I don't know. Like $500 for 50 opinions from college to like, have my app then you like all of a sudden or you have $10 per person and you you guys can take some of that money you could give some to the student I don't know you can like almost crowdsource the opinion as opposed to have it be like one person's full like externship, I guess     Christina Maroun 23:56   I actually have a few questions about your, your product. Yeah, I was. I was just curious about like, how many users do you currently have? Yeah, we     Interviewee 24:07   have like 500 clients right now.     Christina Maroun 24:12   Another thing I was curious about, so I did actually sign up Yeah, I have to continue the process. So like, eventually, do you plan on developing like a mobile app? Yep.     Interviewee 24:27   It's like next next step for us. For sure. We just wanted to basically like build the web, but be able to test like, Hey, can do we actually have product market fit? Like are people liking this and people signing up? And then we'll invest in building a mobile app to? Yeah, cool. Well, this is fun. Feel free to reach out over email like if you have any other kind of like thoughts or stuff or, or ball my opinions on things. I'd be glad to give it and let me know. Like if you end up building this, it'd be really cool. Yeah.     Christina Maroun 25:02   Thank you so much. Yeah. Have a good day too. ", Partially resonated , -Filled out form on mock website- , N/A ," that stood out was the 100 person teams. I was like, Oh, that's interesting. At one I wonder how much this is gonna cost. I immediately was like, oh, man, do I need a lot of money to be able to do this? Because 100 people seems like a lot. And then I was like, oh, maybe it's like offshoring or something. So very curious what that means. But that definitely stood out. Yeah, I mean, that was the biggest one. The first two. I think like, not Yeah, it doesn't jump out as much to me expert lead makes me think like who or who's your team and then seeing the AI people like no credentials.

", Burning cash and wasting time ," I would say build it in the wrong products. Probably the biggest one though, yeah, because I think like to me, I want like the focus at this stage is to hit product market fit and to me Product Market Fit means you have the right product for the right people.

Doing?     Unknown Speaker 6:51   I am doing well. Awesome man.     Unknown Speaker 6:58   I guess I just joined via the link     Speaker 2 7:04   it is okay welcome welcome welcome. I have my AI assistants taking notes for me. All right. All right. So thank you so much for taking the time to participate in this research session. Um, don't want it to be too much, but I really appreciate it. We're conducting okay, we've gone I mean, put my mind recording in progress. All right. So we're conducting this research to gain insight on a product that we're currently that is currently under deployment. So rest assured that all your responses today will remain confidential. We'd like to record this session to ensure that we capture all of your feedback accurately, allowing us to focus more on our conversation. And is that alright with you?     Unknown Speaker 7:59   Yes, that's good. Sounds good.     Speaker 2 8:04   All right. So introduction is that I'm a product research team for a new product. And today I would love your input and your insight on particular aspects of it. The main goal of this session is to understand your reaction and to see or products messaging and how it resonates with you. So it's really important for me to hear your honest thoughts. So please don't pull back anything that you have to say your feedback, both positive and negative, will be invaluable. I'm here to listen and to learn and if at any point you have any questions just let me know. Alright, so start by me sending you a mock website. So hold on here. Okay. Like I'm gonna send you a mock website in the chat. So let me know if you are able to see it. Yes, I see the link. Once you click on it, I would love for you to share your screen me if possible.     Unknown Speaker 9:12   If not one sec. Yes, take your time.     Speaker 3 9:38   It says that I can't boast disabled participant screen sharing.     Unknown Speaker 9:43   Try one more time. Alright, little technical difficulties.     Unknown Speaker 9:52   Of course, no worries. All right. So     Speaker 2 10:00   let's go ahead. Alright. So thank you. This is good. You know, know that you have really brought up the screen. First of all, I just want you to take your time, you know, go through it. Once you have gone through, then you know, we will start at the top by me just asking you, you know, just basic questions to just get your feedback. So just take at least two minutes or a second just to go through anything as well and probably even you know, while you're going through it, just provide any feedback that you see and ask any questions that you see relevant as well.     Speaker 2 12:33   Right. All right. So while you're back there okay, go ahead.     Unknown Speaker 13:13   All right. Alright. So     Speaker 3 13:17   feedback. I mean, the layout is pretty, right. It's not flooded, or anything right. So I like the layout. That's the first thing like the logo up top. However, at the bottom, like when you're finished, scroll down. I wish there was like something going here. They could click that quickly or automatically just brings you up to the top you know, yeah, that's one I mean, it's not a big deal. But this you know, these images we can I can clearly see that its AI is AI generated. So yeah, I would prefer it to be like, real people like actual people, instead of AI. Right, because that would allow me to, like, trust the website more, or trust what's going on here, like, you know, seeing somebody and seeing a face these links don't work. So there's no way to validate this. You know, like, no social media, no, even at LinkedIn. Normally. Companies established companies or, you know, most companies who are serious, they would most likely have at least a LinkedIn. So this is a recommendation that I would have that ensure that these links these social links work. If there is no Facebook, no Instagram, no Twitter, or whatever. I would leave it off of the website. Right so that there wouldn't be a question like this like why? Why are these links working? Right.     Speaker 1 15:25   What else? I think maybe let me see. Absolutely. Product Market Fit.     Speaker 3 15:38   It's a lot of like, sentences that aren't like, fully. Like the idea, I get the idea, right? But this sentence is don't like they aren't engaging. Right? And some of these sentences are incomplete. Right. So reading through it is like, on a chopping board. You know, like cutting up carrots. is like just chop chop, chop, chop, chop. Right. There is no it's not small. It's not concurrent. And reading through, it kinda kind of gets tiring. Like I was reading through like these bunch of questions, like every time you scroll down and reading something new, is like a bunch of questions. It's not like driving are telling us story. You know, it's more so like, Oh, you have this? Yeah, that, that you need this. What do you think about that kind of thing, rather than telling a story and driving, you know, like, leading lead me in a way to like, understand and see my problem, my luck, you know, where I would need this service, you know, to, to fulfill or to drive a solution that I would need. So that story is is not really there. So, one a high level. That's it.     Speaker 2 17:12   Okay. Oh, wow. Okay. That feedback is really good to know that. You know, you have you know, quite really good things to say very good insight that you know, we will take into consideration wanted to wanted you to go out here and just, you know, just you know settled right here in the accelerate product market fit right. And you know, totally What's your overall impression of the message     Unknown Speaker 17:46   accelerate product market fit. Like     Speaker 3 17:53   what is their first impression, right first impression last right. I would say the reason why I am going through this website, really, you know, is because this is, this is something that we're doing right? This is a review, but I'm just landing on this on this homepage. It's I don't know if it's the colors or it's clean. Let's get out well, I like I like the clean the cleanliness of it always not attention grabbing. Right. If I am not aware of what I am looking for you know, it wouldn't be hard to find here. So, I see right here, accelerate, accelerate, product market fit right. And then after that it says deeply understand your customer. validate your solution, build traction test your business model, launch a product market fit relationship and extend your runway. Okay. And then, you know, right after that, there's a call to action get started.     Speaker 2 19:09   And how does that mean? You read it, like, is it like washed, or you're not able to, you know, synthesize it properly.     Speaker 3 19:17   Right. Both of those rushed and it all goes back to telling that story. Right, driving the story. You know, like, pushing, pushing, Well, honestly, taking a solution first methodology. Right. So you want to push a solution, but also drive that story as to what I am missing. Why or would this benefit me? Right? I mean, it's here but our have to dig through it to find it.     Speaker 2 19:54   Absolutely. Right. That's great feedback. Love that low back. Definitely something we can we are going to work on you know what, what stands out to you positively in a positive light?     Speaker 3 20:10   From Yeah, so I like this down here like 100 Plus customer interviews fully manage insight at scale. I mean, I think this probably could have been like, more, more interface because this is something that you want to highlight to say, alright, we have experience here. You know, this is home when a customer interviews that we've done to drive that trust, you know, it kind of blend in pretty much like it's of smaller font than up here. Which is which is I can understand that because this this is the the landing page, but this is also important, you know, to build close, I mean, to drive trust, right, and to show that, you know, you've been active, you know what you're doing, you're a leader in this space, right. So I would probably, I like that is here and not like way down here somewhere. So I like that it's right here. You know, just more in your face, kind of a little bit.     Speaker 2 21:18   Going on to the next section, which is the problem. I'm just wanting to x the phrases that you see on the right hand side of your screen, how these phrases resonate with you. Such as the wasting time burning cash, building the wrong product.     Unknown Speaker 21:39   Well, me specifically. I guess the only one that would resonate with me is     Speaker 3 21:49   I would say wasting time, but not really, because I do have processes in place to ensure that that is not happening. Burning of cash. Due to the nature of my business. That doesn't happen doesn't apply to me, as well as building the wrong wrong product. I do have a process in place to ensure that that will not be the case. You know, with many iterations on reviews from the from the client before we pushed the end product. So I would say the only one that might just a little bit applied to me would be wasting of time.     Speaker 2 22:37   Do you think that there could be other phrases that could be in there that would you think would resonate with you mean specifically? Yeah,     Speaker 3 22:45   like alright, alright, so you know, like, like, anything really, we're like driving plan customer relationship or like gaining new clients like stuff like that. Obviously, whatever business it is, you're gonna want more clients, you know. So, yeah, especially for startups. I would say that. That's, that's one of the big things is to drive clients so that you can have that consistent cash flow, to reinvest in the company and pay off debts or whatever the case may be.     Speaker 2 23:30   Okay, thank you. Yeah. We're gonna go to the deeply understand your customer section here. And what's your understanding of this particular feature? By itself, where understand your target customer validate solutions, your solutions with target customers? So what's your understanding of this feature?     Speaker 3 23:58   Alright, so I like this right here. This is geared towards, like getting you to think Alright, so I like the set of questions. The quota on the set of questions here to me and on what do you know your customer? Right? I think that's that's a very important question to ask any business owner? Right? Obviously, you would think you know your customer until you actually start diving deep and putting things on paper to understand how well do you know your customer? So I like that question. Right. The question is, Well, today's what's the next lesson here? What are their most severe pains? Like that question as well. That's perfect. Or are they addressing them today? Yeah, that's a good question as well. Over that will vary based on client based on customer? How much are they spending to do that? That's also a good question. Because knowing the answer to that can position you in a way where I wouldn't say you will undercut the market but you will provide more values, your you know where they're at, you know, their problems, you know, how much they're spending. So that will help you to tailor a package that would both fulfill their desire the probe solve a problem that they're having at a good price point. So, I do like this set of questions here. Like this is really good.     Speaker 2 25:40   Nice. This is great. This is great. We're gonna go to the social proof section, where the company logos, and how do these testimonials or endorsements influence your view of the product or service that's being offered here?     Speaker 3 26:05   Well, I mean, seeing like, Google have these like, well known and reputable brands, of course, it would drive a little bit more trust, you know, to say, okay, all right. You guys, work with these big companies. All right. Awesome. So you know, it will drive a little more, more trust. The next thing is how do you verify that, you know, when you go into social media to be social, social icons, and there's nothing     Speaker 2 26:42   I was going to ask you that question because it came up in my mind, because I'm just trolling you know, your thoughts and your feedback on the product and I'm like, Okay, I need to ask him, How does the the, you know, the social media is not popping up and also with the AIP sees compared to this? It's a contradiction, right? Exactly.     Speaker 3 27:06   Yep, yep. And here, you're saying that okay, or advantage. All right, sir, I'd been to is that it's fully manage expert led large project teams I mean, I don't really know that. I'm seeing I'm seeing it here on paper, but there is no way for me to actually know that is true. Because anybody can download these logos from Google and put it on your website to say, Oh, I work with these setups. I work with these people, you know, but seeing it right off the bat, you would invoke some kind of trust some form of relevance say okay, this company work with these people. And until you start to dig a little bit deeper to you know, to find this company or the website, somewhere else, reference somewhere else other than on this website here, other than external slash AI that works with IO. Like, where else are you present? Are you only present on this web address or are you present somewhere else on the internet?     Speaker 2 28:15   Okay, that makes a good point. Do you also, what do you think about if they're prisons are all their prisons are the reference of their work or calibration is mentioned on the clients website? Do you think that? Oh, yeah.     Speaker 3 28:31   Yeah, that's a big thing if the client mentions you, right, because it shows that that's proof in itself, right? That you did some form of work. One thing another thing that I would add here that I don't see is some form of review section. Like, I'm sure you guys, you guys said that you work with 100 Plus, customer interviews or whatever, right? Um, where are they? Where are the reviews? I don't see any reviews. That's a big deal in this century, like, good. People like to follow people. Right? And if there are no reviews, then that's another thing or do I know that this website is real, or this company is real? Or is actually doing what they say they're doing?     Speaker 2 29:23   Right, that you make a good valid point as well. I think that is something I'm a person that goes off views. So it is good that we can incorporate the views to you know, enhance the trust in the product as well. Right. So yeah, it really will speak volumes of you know, you know, or services that we offer to our clients as well. So, you know, definitely taking that into consideration. And for the advantage section. Your free will be ended in 10 minutes or at least 10 minutes. All right. So, advantage section. What's your initial reaction to this advantage section here? You know what, what was your initial thought when you scroll on site?     Transcribed by https://otter.ai "," The value proposition resonated with the interviewee in terms of the services that is being offered on the website, however, there is a need for trust based on the limited activation of various user face such as stakeholder links to bios and ore about the organization background along with purpose. The idea is well resonated in terms of the delivery but understanding of the content is limited with questions distracts the consumer from the story without driving assurance.

I'm glad that that's there because that's the button that I clicked on to speak with one of the experts so I wouldn't be mistaken on this page. Exactly what I'm here to do. So. Okay. I mean, at this point, I wouldn't even read this again. I would just go straight to it. </li><li>Because if, if I'm if I'm clicking the get started button, I would believe that I have, you know, enough interest and you know, social proof already garnered to say, Okay, I trust this and I'm going to try it out.

Emphasizing the importance of a meeting, he asserts that he would not proceed with a purchase without having his inquiries addressed. ",," The founder resonated with 'Fully managed', a resonated little with 'Expert Led', and he mentioned that he won't care about 'Large Project Teams'. As a founder, his primary concern when utilizing a service like this is risk management. Engaging in numerous customer conversations is seen as a crucial exercise in minimizing the overall risk profile of his venture. The purpose of using such a service is to lower the risk associated with his business. In his perspective, there's a constant trade-off between spending money and risking his time. When considering this, He is focused on maximizing the value received for the least amount of money and risk. He is particularly interested in understanding how the service can assist him, such as conducting 10 interviews for validation at a cost of $100, enabling him to make informed decisions and then proceed with additional steps. In essence, he wants to know how the service will help him effectively manage and reduce the risks involved in his entrepreneurial endeavours.

The founder feels a lack of connection with larger companies like Beats by Dr.Dre, HP Tech Ventures, Snapchat, and Energy Innovation Capital. He suggests reconsidering the client list to better align with the needs of smaller startups.  2. He focuses on maximizing value for the least amount of money and risk. He is interested in understanding how the service can effectively assist in reducing entrepreneurial risks.  3. He believes the service is not tailored for individual founders navigating niche ideas. He seeks specifics of results from customer interviews for a more compelling proposition.  4. He is interested in engaging services early on for minimal cost to conduct interviews and create a landing page.  He is significantly influenced by knowing deliverables and pricing details before making a decision.  5. He expresses intent to click the 'Get Started' button on the landing page for a meeting. He asserts that a meeting is essential before making a purchase decision. "," In his opinion, this service is conducting customer interviews for large companies, and it seems that this business model isn't tailored for individual founders like him navigating the challenges of a niche idea. If he engages in this service for customer interviews, it could not mitigate his risks. Knowing the specifics of the results obtained from these interviews would make this service more compelling. His primary interest lies in leveraging this service to decrease his risk exposure with the least financial investment. He also wondered about the feasibility of engaging these services early on, perhaps for a minimal cost like $200, to conduct 10 interviews and create a landing page.

Their first product is the MarsCharger Lite, the ‘Jerry Can’ for EVs, a mobile EV charger that can also provide power to homes, equipment, and electronic devices.",https://marscharge.com/,B2C,Technology / Auto / Engineering,"The interviewee is the founder of the company. He went to NYU, and recently launched the company Mars Charge around a year ago, where he recently got a grant from the government and signed terms."," Speaker 1 2:46   I'm a student at NYU and I'm part of this research team for this class to gather insights on this product that's under development. I saw your I was looking at the onto the NYU entrepreneurship site and I saw your startup and I thought the idea was super cool. So I thought that I was wondering if it'd be alright, to get your insights on this particular product? Sure,     Speaker 2 3:09   sure. Yeah. Which one? Um, are a big one or a small one?     Speaker 1 3:13   Um, it's under development. Oh, it would be for my product, like getting your responses and feedback. Oh, okay. Sure, no problem. Okay, cool. Um, basically, it's going to be a website walkthrough. I have the website here that I can link in chat. And wouldn't it be alright if I recorded this just to look back for a personal Yeah, sure. Thanks. recording in progress. Okay, so this is the website. Um This first page right here is a summary or Overview section. After reading the message and the title What are your what's your overall impression of the message     Speaker 2 4:06   accelerate product market fit validate your solution, build traction test your business model. Yeah, I think it's my overall impression is, is I understand the text like I understand that process. I've done a lot of it. And if you're selling like a solution to me, like customer interviews and such, I would say yes, but I think the image maybe the because you know so much you know, I've done so much of this marketing stuff. And and, and I know from the people we've hired and all the stuff I've read up on is the if you could, my only feedback is is first of all, it looks great. Looks very professional. It looks like you're selling a solution. Maybe, you know, people think visually or you know, they say a picture says 1000 words, so maybe some sort of picture that maybe communicates that idea or more saves. You know what I mean? Like rather than just a plain computer Exactly. There     Unknown Speaker 5:04   is that doesn't really I don't know what that would be maybe     Speaker 2 5:06   that's kind of an empty advice, but no, yeah, no, no, I     Speaker 1 5:09   see what you're saying. Because like, I feel like this photo doesn't say much about what we're trying to sell. Okay.     Speaker 2 5:16   Yeah, I know as someone who's done like, sorry if I'm a bit groggy this morning with the someone who's done hundreds and hundreds of those interviews, you know, if you know if we Yeah, if you had us a way to convince a startup that I can save you all that time of doing those interviews, that would be a might be a worthwhile so I know at the NYU stuff right away. There are all these technical founders who don't, since they don't have the patience or they, they don't want the patients to be able to conduct those interviews. Yeah.     Speaker 1 5:51   Okay, so next scrolling down is the problem section. Um, after reading it, how do these phrases resonate with you? Or have you encountered any of these issues before     Speaker 2 6:02   wasting time bringing cash Yeah, pretty good. Online limited resources. Yeah, this is this is all true stuff. Yeah, the problem yeah, I'd make it bigger. And, and maybe you can maybe make the stop section bigger. Be like maybe something red, you know, like a stop sign where it's like, Oh, stop. Yeah, like wasting time. Yeah. Okay. I mean, I'm not a very good I hope this helps. Because I'm not I'm not really much of a UX guy myself in terms of websites, but you know, no, product. Yeah.     Speaker 1 6:44   So in general, like the message would draw you in or resonate with you in a certain way. If you were potentially to be interested in the product.     Unknown Speaker 6:56   Yeah, yeah, exactly. Okay.     Speaker 1 7:00   Um, so below that is the feature section. There's three different features deeply understand your target customer, validate your solution with target customers and then build traction with early adopters and it kind of goes into the specifics of how like our company or our service would do that. I see based on so for each feature like What's your understanding of the future and does it appeal to you in any way?     Speaker 2 7:27   Sure. Oh, I see. We hold on maybe you can share your screen and maybe we can because I look what section Am I looking at? I'm looking at the problem section or the deeply understand your target customer. Yeah,     Unknown Speaker 7:39   deeply understand your target customer.     Speaker 2 7:43   Yeah, I guess I guess what I see is, you know, just general marketing copy, I think, you know, how, you know, like, maybe, like I said, maybe at this point, if you're trying to sell a product, maybe you'd show like if it's a software as a service type product. Maybe you'd show like a outline of the actual software and say, Hey, we conducted this interview, you know, whatever it is, if it's like a spreadsheet or something if that's what you're trying to sell like a software as a service. It was sounds like is what you're selling. Yeah. Yeah, like, yeah, at that point, you would show a demo of the product and say, Wow, we can bank all these, these these customer interviews and do the customer and discover promises and have a metric way to to do that, that that, you know, that's something I would I would say so adding like Yeah, cuz it's like, I mean, generally speaking, when you when you do these pitch tech startups, and I don't know if you've ever given the startup role, their beats, I've been to a million of these workshops now. And the typical format is like, you know, broadly, broadly, what's, what's the industry problem solution? And that same with marketing, it's like, what's your problem? Okay, you've got me at my problem. And now the solution is your is your product. So that was the product     Speaker 1 9:05   Exactly. Okay. Yeah. So for this part, instead of just kind of broadly outlining the solution, go into more examples and like, how our service is going to technically solve that.     Speaker 2 9:18   Yeah, if you're doing like a mock service for your project, project, just just get like I would say, like get a stock image, or or just make something in 3d art or something. Yeah, that that that says, hey, we're gonna make this software solution and this is your solution as you because broadly, what is the solution? You know, as a company, you're selling solutions. So So you want to sell eat what you what's the solution, pay me money. Basically, will solve your problem.     Speaker 1 9:51   And then under that it's valid at your solution with target customers. It's the section right under that and then build traction with your early adopters. Do those messages resonate with you in any way? Do you have any positive or negative feedback about those or is it like generally the same?     Speaker 2 10:08   Yeah, that's pretty good. Like I would say, like validate your solution and target customers. And then again, I would say I would spend these time in the in these images. I wouldn't change any of your messages. I would just like, like your messaging is great. But like if you can show and I realized this is just a school project, but if you can show you know you know how the software takes those cutters or interviews and convert them into customers. I mean, you know, if you could create a sleeve, I mean, to be honest, I know this is just a project where you can create a solution for that like, like you're basically you're you're doing all that you're really helping all these onto early stage entrepreneurs. Yeah, no work.     Speaker 1 10:49   Yeah. Well, technically like the service we're selling is employing like a team of people in order to do this research for the entrepreneur. And like those people are doing like using AI and using like certain services. In order to do that. So um,     Speaker 2 11:08   yeah, we definitely say I would definitely say show it you got it. Like you know, they say show don't tell. I don't like our first customers are like these Midwestern shipping companies, and they're definitely a show me like so. Like, show the software or show like something     Speaker 1 11:26   Yeah, like connecting on a more personal level I could, like include like, who the team is or like what they're doing specifically in order to make this happen     Speaker 2 11:35   if it's a software like show like, like, for example, yeah, like show okay, like the first step validate customer show, like, the actual software and then the second one would be like, show how those that the in that book or software or something like the customers have been booked or something. And then And then, you know, usually, obviously again, I know it's just a research project, but usually that's when the you show like general website. Design is where you show testimonials like hey, we can like like this. This company would say Oh, testimonial from an entrepreneur saying, you know, Hey, your product, what's it called? Webflow or     Unknown Speaker 12:21   x turn? Yeah. Next turn.     Speaker 2 12:23   Yeah, next turn. Yeah, so, yeah, what you would do is you just say, hey, they helped us close. They helped us discover the key feature set validate feature sets in our product or by interviewing 100 customers. And then one of them two or three of those. Those interviews actually converted into first pilots. The customer Yeah,     Speaker 1 12:46   yeah, that kind of that kind of answered my next question. Um, right below that there's a social proof section which has like, like hypothetical, like partnerships, um, but I do think that adding like real testimonials, and like examples, from like successful examples from the past would definitely add to that other than just showing like social media proof of companies worked with. But based on that, like, do you think that these endorsements would influence you your view of the product in any way?     Speaker 2 13:23   You mean, from these specific companies? Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I mean, maybe maybe Snapchat. I mean, it depends on how old the company was. If it's a new one. It Beats by Dre. Not so much. Yeah, HP? Not really. You know, because if you're if you're selling to, if you're selling to startups, you know, maybe I hope like I don't know how old the company is, but let's say it's a brand new company. You'd want to do something that's recently closed for seed funding, because I guess as a startup person who's right now going through that process, you know, there's no connection to me if you've if you've done something with hp, because that's a big corporate that's been around for 50 years. Exactly. It's by Dre celebrity brand where the guy had a lot of money anyway just basically label the product with his his mark his label, his branding on it, okay, whatever. Yeah, not really. Yeah. So     Speaker 1 14:21   so more like recent companies, startups, stuff like that, that we've worked with, instead of like large companies,     Speaker 2 14:27   and not that high profile startups are bad, but if you actually help them in the beginning stages, that's also great, too, right. So     Speaker 1 14:33   and since that is like the service we're trying to sell, it wouldn't make more sense to have those companies there too. Okay.     Speaker 2 14:40   Yeah, exactly. Yeah, like even if there are no name companies, like, you know, and like because of me as a startup be like, Oh, they're working with tech ventures. Okay. Well, then that seems like some sort of thing. I would only sign up with them because I'm interested in maybe getting an introduction to the funding Avenue, right, because that's like, that's like your number two job. Like, number one, the beginning. It's your number one job, but then you're no, it's your number two job as a startup founder to keep raising capital, even from every and every place. So yeah, you know, yeah, so yeah, I would say yeah, that's my thing. It's like, testimonial like, hey, Company X, even if it's a no name company, like does it like no one's ever heard of Yeah. Like, it doesn't matter say, hey, they really helped us. Like we were doing the customer discovery process and bashing our heads against the wall. They came in with their targeted solution and they gave us a supercharged or customer discovery to ended up turning it into clients. Right, exactly.     Speaker 1 15:36   Okay, yeah. Awesome. And then the last section is the advantage section. It basically like outlines like the three main advantages of it, and um,     Unknown Speaker 15:49   I was wondering like, what's your initial reaction to this specific portion? And then would you be inclined to get started and enter your information if you were like, hypothetically, like looking to do one of these services?     Speaker 2 16:04   Yeah, like I said, all of the copy and the flow is good. You know, overall, but I think the only reason why I wouldn't do it is because I don't see like a physical because it's like, forgive me if I'm wrong, but it seems like a software as a solution type saying, like, SAS Type, or is it just     Speaker 1 16:27   it? I mean, technically, it's like yeah, consulting, in a way. It's like a team of people working and I think, yeah, part of it is like using software in order to like, provide like, like the services but yeah, so I think it's a combination of maybe     Speaker 2 16:42   it was it's more of a consulting, maybe just show your team like in the meeting room. At the office. Yeah. Even if it's like a messy office. You know, like I mean, look at I mean, our lab is not but but it's a pictures of like, what the solution is and and yeah, I think that that's my only right. Okay, yeah, I might do I mean, if we were in that state, I mean, we're kind of at that stage now. But I might, yeah, I might sign up for something like that saved me a lot of time, especially as a solo founder. I've had to do everything.     Speaker 1 17:14   Yeah, yeah, yeah. So overall, like what are your main takeaways or like positives or negatives about it?     Speaker 2 17:22   Oh, yeah. Positives very professional looking. Looks like a looks like a good. Like, it looks like a real company website that I would want to do. Some of your more Yeah. Yeah, I think it's good. Like I said, I think like I said, my only critique is a I guess you got these AI people here, obviously, fill it out with real people. But um, but yeah, that's my only thing is like, I guess my only critique is the images themselves because, you know, an image, you know, picture a photo says 1000 words. So, you know, maybe if you'd show I guess if it's a school projects, pictures of you guys. Yeah,     Unknown Speaker 18:04   exactly. Folks, there's     Speaker 2 18:05   something we're gonna work around like, you know, like the silly staged ones. Like people looking very serious. Yeah. We're gonna work around the clock. Yeah.     Speaker 1 18:13   Okay. Um, yeah. Other than that, that that's the end of the website. Um, thank you so much for taking the time to do this interview and your feedback was super valuable. No problem. Yeah. But other than that, if you have any other questions or anything, feel free to let me know. Okay,     Speaker 2 18:32   great. Yeah.

Let let me know where you want to get rolling and we can get after it.     Christina Maroun 0:06   Yeah. Okay, I'll share the website link in the chat     and then you know once you get the link, just share your screen     Interviewee 0:32   Yeah. And you want me to just sort of talk out loud as I scroll through it. Yeah,     Christina Maroun 0:40   just, yeah. As you scroll, scroll through just as you go for each section. Just say your thoughts out loud.     Interviewee 0:49   Okay. first thought is I find the headline appealing. I'm a little bit skeptical. Just because, you know, as a small business owner Product Market Fit seems like a tough thing to get external help creating but definitely curious enough to learn more. This seems like a lot of words. But deeply understand your customer value, solution, build traction, business model, launch and product market fit. Extension. I don't know what an externship is but extend your runway. This feels like a lot. I still don't know what the company does after reading that hearing test okay. Any percent of startups fail Yeah. Eliminate research teams on the staff. I feel that you've never done this before. I agree. I agree. I agree. That wasting time stop burning cash building around product deeply understand your target customer. Customer Okay.     Building your products. I agree with all of this. I still don't really know what the company does the work the service is on track     I agree with that as well.     Some good logos. So makes me feel like it seems. I feel like we sort of struggle with this too because we mark it to like small bit of an aim like the clients that most in body the new clients we would like to get are not recognizable logos, because you know, they're like a bowling alley in rural Pennsylvania or like a you know, very small startup in San Francisco. And so like, like, it's comforting to see like Snapchat in Beats by Dre. But I don't identify with that as a company, if that makes sense. So yeah. Like I haven't figured out how to solve it for us either. And us little observation I had managed managed     interesting I'm not really sure like that output is quite yet like like what what the end deliverable sort of looks like if the team all very good looking people Yeah, okay. So yeah, getting all the way to the bottom. I'm still not sure what I would be getting what the kind of like timeline would be in how much this would cost because one of our experts Yes, I could talk to them to figure that out. But I wouldn't probably say since I'm still not entirely sure. You know what the output would be or you know, if there's any sort of like chance I can afford it, because like, you know, it seems like this is marketed to smaller companies. I feel like I'm the target market. But then when I think about like 100 person team, it's like, oh, I can't afford that, probably. And I'm still not entirely sure what the end output I would get from it would be because, you know, up here, this definitely has a very wide net. And if I had to guess I feel like this is like a service to sort of outsource and accelerate customer interviews and generate some learnings from that. You know, I would love to, as a small business owner, I would love to, like, get a feeling for what what like the end deliverable would be because in my mind, hopefully that would be useful not just for, you know, guiding like our product development, but also potentially for garnering additional investment or something like that. So, yeah, that's my thinking. How's that? How's that? Sorry. Sorry if that was hyper critical, or anything?     Christina Maroun 6:30   No, that's totally fine. All feedback is good feedback. Do you mind still sharing your screen? Oh, yeah.     Interviewee 6:47   Yeah. So yeah, I think that's, that's my thinking on the website.     Christina Maroun 7:01   Yeah, um, I'm just gonna ask you a few follow up questions and then okay. Yeah. Um, so I guess like starting here, this section here. Does this message resonate with any particular needs or challenges you're currently facing?     Interviewee 7:27   I'm sort of I mean, it would be great if we can accelerate our product market fit, but it's I and then down here, it seems like this is a bit to run. Almost like it's a it makes me feel a little bit skeptical because it feels like it's an over promise, especially for what we reasonably be able to afford.     Christina Maroun 8:04   Did you scroll to the problem section?     Interviewee 8:07   Yeah.     Christina Maroun 8:10   So with these problems listed, would you be able to share more about your experience with those problems?     Interviewee 8:19   Yeah, I mean, time is money in startups don't have a lot of either. So definitely resonates with me. I've, I've worked at a startup before that had to pivot a few times and every time it felt like the odds of it being successful, by like, 90%. And so you know, I think through if we knew what we knew at the end at the beginning, how much better our odds of actually surviving would have been. But I yeah, I resonate with all of this     Christina Maroun 9:00   okay, I'm just curious but did your previous startup to the end the surviving after     Interviewee 9:09   kind of a it's sort of still like lumbering on is a bit of a zombie. They they managed to raise $50 million. And so but recently laid off, like 96% of the staff, so went from, you know, 70 people down to four. And so, that's ultimately what kind of launched my current startup I had the option to stay on but ultimately decided to take some severance, take some of the team that got some severance, and launch my current company. So yeah, we sort of spun out of a startup that was in the process of failing     Christina Maroun 9:56   just scroll down to the I guess like the features sections were deeply understand your target customer validate your solution of target customers build traction early adopters, those three features. Are there like certain aspects that like appeal to you? Or are there certain aspects that like don't really appeal to you? If you could elaborate more on that?     Interviewee 10:23   I so I mean, they all appeal to me conceptually, but if I was thinking about like, shouldn't my company pay money for this? I feel like it's, it's a bit too vague. Like, like, this section sort of makes me feel like this company as a whole doesn't really you know, just vague business speech and stock photography and yeah, so like, like, I think this is the section where I become more skeptical that like the product exists at all. Yeah.     Christina Maroun 11:11   You scroll down to the advantage section.     Interviewee 11:15   Yeah, I like this section, but the ultimate advantage. Yeah.     Christina Maroun 11:19   If you want to talk more about the previous section, you can Oh, I     Interviewee 11:23   just feel like, this is a good confidence builder. I feel like going through this section. My confidence was a little shaken. And then I'm like, Alright, I see some logo. So I'm like, maybe I'm missing something because clearly somebody else has figured this out. And so yeah, that's just the thinking there. Alright, I'm on the advantage section.     Christina Maroun 11:51   So with the advantage section at the features within it rds, do you find these features valuable or important to your needs?     Interviewee 12:04   Um, I think I would, I think at this point, I'm, I've missed sort of like the concrete one to do sentences of what what this thing is. So like, like, given, given that, like, I would like anything to be fully managed and expertly LED. But I don't know if that thing that's being fully managed, or the thing that's being expertly LED is something I want or mean. Because I think everything's just still a bit too vague. And then I find this last one actually a little off putting     Christina Maroun 12:59   um, so those are all the follow up questions I had. Okay. Do you have do you have any other overall thoughts, feedback or recommendations or questions? Um,     Interviewee 13:14   uh, yeah, I think I would just I would, I would maybe like think about, like, what, whoever is running this or whatever you're putting together I would, I would think about writing this copy not as like you want to impress people not as like, like, I feel like it's always difficult when you are actually like bringing a product to market because you become so familiar with it that you sort of forget what it's what it's like to look at it with fresh eyes as somebody who knows nothing about this. And like, most like, like, I've spent, you know, 10 years working in San Francisco been in startups in tech. Basically, my entire career. So like, I feel like I'm, I'm more aware of like the value of like user research and product testing and like, a lot of this stuff than like the average person and I'm still slightly confused. So like, just reading it as like reading your your value prop in your website as like content that like your grandma would understand is always like a good a good place to start.     Christina Maroun 14:38   Do you have any other feedback or questions?     Interviewee 14:44   No, I think that that about desert is so I guess the question would be what what what is this?     Christina Maroun 14:53   Oh, the product? Yeah, yeah. Um, so the gist of the product. It's, you know, aimed towards early stage. Startups. What's been advertised is externship. Oh, I was curious. Uh, what do you think externship is?     Interviewee 15:25   Honestly, don't know I'm just guessing by the pieces of the word where it's like, an internship but with people who don't work at the company, maybe. So. Yeah. That would be my guess.     Christina Maroun 15:46   Yeah, um, so pretty much what an externship is. It's similar to an internship. But the differences are, they tend to be more accessible, flexible, typically shorter and more structured compared to an internship and the aim the aim for that like it's usually for college students or like recent graduates. see pretty much just mock website it's adver tising. The product of like an externship to help you know, early stage startup with there any any business problems are trying to tackle but I guess like, in particular with the mock website is advertising specifically is more, I guess, user research. The interviews. Yeah. Okay.     Interviewee 16:45   Okay, that that, that makes more sense. Yeah, I just I didn't know what an externship was. So that was kind of like what this is. Yes. Okay. Oh, go ahead and say Oh,     Christina Maroun 17:05   I was just wondering if you had any more feedback or questions? No,     Interviewee 17:10   I mean, I would. I would definitely. Well, you know, for this to be most useful for me, working in an section explaining what an externship was, and would be helpful for me     Christina Maroun 17:33   anything else? No.     Interviewee 17:35   I think that that'll do it. Awesome. All right. Anything else I can do for you? That's awesome. Well, best of luck, Christina. Nice meeting you.     Christina Maroun 17:48   Yeah, it was nice meeting you. Thank you so much for your feedback in time. Of     Interviewee 17:53   course. Have a good day. Bye. Bye.

And I think an AI could work you have to train it is going to be hard and expensive but doable.

My husband's a professor at Purdue I used to so I die. I'm actually really surprised that you heard about it from countries because I just assumed like I'm you know, plugged in to the ecosystem. So I just assumed someone at Purdue told you about  1  Speaker 1  1:14  that is because on your on the website and Christmas it says Virginia or something it doesn't say like wait, make sure I'm correct. It does not say Indiana for sure. So  2  Speaker 2  1:23  a lot of you know there's a lot of inaccurate information.

I have to leave a few minutes early because I have a meeting right after this. Completely  1  Speaker 1  1:45  fine looking fine. Let's get to it. So I will send you an email right now about the so let me tell you why. I'm sending an email a little bit about like what this is about. So I'm extra funding for a company right now who's trying to develop a new product and they're asking if startups would be interested in like if it's something that they would like to like, if this will be something that'll be helpful, so I'm sorry, I can't think and type at the same time.        2:13  You're doing great.  1  Speaker 1  2:14  Thank you.

Yes,        2:59  do people still call at Krannert or have been?  1  Speaker 1  3:01  It's like, oh, it's Daniels. We don't say that here. You don't say kind of anymore.

Okay,  2  Speaker 2  5:19  so accelerate product market fit. deeply understand your customer, validate your solution test your business model, I guess so. First of all, the word externship is not I don't think I've heard that before. So I'm not exactly sure what that is. I know internship or externship. So that's just a comment. I'll click on get started. But the so 100 customer discovery interviews caught my attention. backstory for you is prior to founding this startup, I actually worked at the startup incubator at Purdue University. And so I'm a big advocate of customer discovery I've been through I've trained startups on how to conduct customer discovery not trying to make it sound like I'm an expert, but I do have experience being on the support side recommending more customer discovery, interviews for startups. And so for context, I started mine with an eye towards that I've done over 80 So far, we just built our first product like our first beta version of our product, we'll iterate on that do more customer discovery and iterate on it again. That's the current phase we're at. That's a long way of me saying this caught my attention because the impression that I got from this page right or wrong is that this company may do customer discovery for a startup and that I'm not sure that would be helpful, right? Because I've always advocated that the founders need to do customer discovery because the founders really need to understand their customer. I'm misinterpreting what this means. But I just wanted to let you know that that's my first impression and it raises flags in my mind because well, first of all, is that a Can I ask you questions? Or do you? Yes, you can. Okay, is that what this means that this company might do customer discovery for the startup? Yes, that's        7:01  precisely what it means. Okay.  2  Speaker 2  7:03  So my flag is, well, one, there's a lot of founders that I think would take someone up on that there's a lot of people looking for a shortcut to customers. The concern is, the founder needs to understand their customer and the founder needs to be deeply involved in that process. And I worry that if you're basically outsourcing customer discovery, are you actually going to feed that learnings in the company? I would personally be more interested in something that could help me gather insights from those interviews. And so I'll say for example, I've done 80. That's a lot of interviews. That's a lot of content. That's I have them documented. I have been kind of reflecting on what I'm learning and what I'm testing and the questions I'm asking throughout the way, but I'm sure there's insights I'm gonna seen. So I'm actually looking into tools right now trying to solve this problem of if there's any type of AI that can help extract insights from those interviews. So it's a slightly different lens of looking at it, but I I'll give you that feedback. That being said, you know, I have that unique perspective because I worked at a startup incubator, I'm sure there's a lot of founders that would look at this and be like, Oh, my God, I absolutely want someone to help. I just worry that that might be might be actually doing more harm than good.  1  Speaker 1  8:13  Gotcha. Okay. Thank you so much. That was great.  2  Speaker 2  8:17        No problem. I'll get off my soapbox. I'm the problem. Yep, you fail. You're doing work you've never done before. Yep. Wasting time burning cash building the wrong products. Okay, I  1  Speaker 1  8:28        kind of have like a little part to read about the problem section. So I'm just gonna read a little bit. So next, there's a section that discusses some problems people might face how do these phrases wasting time burning cash building the wrong product resonate with you?  2  Speaker 2  8:45  I've always heard that the number one problem or the like, kind of if you bucket it together. One of the top reasons that startups fail is they've misunderstood the market. So basically, they're building something that the market doesn't need. And that's where we always advocate starting with customer discovery, because you really need to understand the problem that your customers have and what they're willing to pay for. Right? So when I see wasting time burning cash, like yes, that's what they're doing, really building the wrong product. So the third point here is the strongest one that sticks out to me I would bump that one up to the top. Okay, you are like not understanding their customer. Okay.        9:34        Jamie, keep going. Um,  1  Speaker 1  9:36        so I kind of have a second question too. Have you encountered any of these problems? And can you share more about that experience? Like if you had,  2  Speaker 2  9:45  um, I'm sure I'm in the process of experiencing these. What I've done so I went full time on my startup in July, and I want to local pitch competitions. So the first one was 20,000. The second one was 40,000. And so that's the 60,000 that I'm using to fund this very early development. I'm in what I've done so far as I focus on customer discovery, like I said, I've done 80 interviews. I'm also doing two customer pilots. So I have one i Without getting into the details. I have five active users at two local companies that are testing. I've been calling it like a no code proof of concept. But what I've done is I've actually earned a little bit of revenue before actually having a product and the reason I'm doing that deep discovery and that deep learning is to hopefully help mitigate the risk of building a product that no one wants, right? You can never eliminate that risk. This along with me saying like the risk is not zero, but hopefully I've mitigated it. And so I'm actually going to launch the beta in the next couple of weeks here. I'm testing it now. And we'll have to see right so like if you ask me in two weeks, I might be like, well, all that mitigations. Still, at the end of the day, I built a product that no one wants, but I'm very hopeful that I'm at least avoiding some obvious pitfalls. Because of the testing and discovery I've done. We'll have to see once it launches, what that response is and then where to iterate from there. But in terms of, you know, for other, you always want to move faster, but for other startups I've seen, right, I'd went from July to early November. I'm about to launch a beta and I've done a bunch of deep discoveries. Like while I would love to make progress faster, I don't feel like I'm wasting time. I think I'm making a good use of time, right? I'm burning cash. I'm not currently taking a salary. So I may, at least for now, so I'm able to really deploy the pitch competition winnings that I have. So I don't feel like I'm wasting money yet. But then always there's a risk of like, you still might be building a product that you need to iterate on because it's a very iterative learning process. So the answer is like kind of for these.  1  Speaker 1  11:42        Okay, thank you. Okay, now if you move on to helpful response, I'm very helpful. No, for sure. Yeah, this is this is great. I'll tell you if like I need something Yeah,  2  Speaker 2  11:54  please. Yeah, please ask me if you want less information, more information.  1  Speaker 1  11:57        They're loving all of this, like this is exactly what they want. Okay, so we're going to go to the feature section. So did you see that on your screen, the feature section  2  Speaker 2  12:07        features such here, no advantages  1  Speaker 1  12:11        so it's deeply understand target customer about it, that part so a little higher? Believe. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. So for each feature, validate your solution with the target customer and build traction early adopters. So what is your understanding of that of what this that says? Like the little blurb that they have on there  2  Speaker 2  12:36  this blurb right here. How are you dressing them spending too much time?  2  Speaker 2  12:45        So it sounds like they're gonna perform interviews with target customers for me as a client. Yes. And then you want me to read this part two.        12:56        Yes, the second part as well?  2  Speaker 2  13:10  It sounds like they're gonna run experiments. To validate what they're hearing in the interviews. I would, I would love to know what types of experiments they're going to do. So for example, is it piloting a low code version of the service or product is it an ads campaign paid advertising campaign? Is it like in product, like kind of in person product testing, like there's a bunch of different ways to run experiments? So I would be curious what additional context there is on that, but at a high level, I understand that they're going to be doing interviews and then they're going to be running some type of tests to validate what they're hearing. Okay,  1  Speaker 1  13:46  and what part of this appeals to you and what part doesn't?  2  Speaker 2  13:51        Do any interviews for me personally does not appeal to me because again, I have this strong belief that the founders need to understand their customers, right. Um, that being said, I think there's a lot of founders that would love to outsource this. So again, take my take my comments with a grain of salt. Again, I think some helping summarize, insights, or maybe, actually what would be interesting is maybe matching interviews that I've done like I would if I was doing 50, and they were doing 50 And that could match the learnings I have. That would be something I'm okay. With, because the founder is still like largely doing a bulk of degree, I'd be much personally more in favor of it being, again, complementary to what I've already done. That could be really interesting. The experiments are more interesting in general than the discovery partly because   +1       +1       of the phase I'm at I'm doing some of my own tests. And I'd love to know, like, is this what types of tests these are? Would this help me test faster? Like would this give me more time and help expedite what I'm doing? or would this be maybe a unique way of testing that I'm not currently doing that would be like an interesting insight. Anyway, I'm much more curious about this. Okay. Sorry, can you that's fine. Go ahead. Hi, how was the girl I'm gonna intervene? Okay. Give me  1  Speaker 1  15:18  we're all good. Okay, we'll move on a little bit. So the social proof section, so it's the I think you're right there with the Great HP tech. Yes. Okay. So how do these testimonials or endorsements influence your view of the product?  2  Speaker 2  15:41  So what's interesting is, on the one hand, these are very notable endorsements. This makes me think that this is something large companies want it makes it seem like they're working with innovation groups at large companies. Right. early stage startups.  1  Speaker 1  15:55  Oh, okay. That's really good. Thank you. Okay.  2  Speaker 2  15:58  Yeah, so I guess my again, very notable, but my takeaway from this is that this might not be a fit for me because I'm very different from HP and Beats by Dre. Gotcha.  1  Speaker 1  16:07        Okay, that's really great. So for now, we're gonna move on to the advantage section. So for each advantage, I just want you to read them a little bit and tell me like, What is your initial reaction and is it something that's important to you like valuable to your, to your brand or not? And why?  2  Speaker 2  16:26  fully managed? Well, well let me just go through out one large project teams expert led, so I think fully managed appeals to me the most because it's again, like there's limited time, there's limited resources. I'm currently a team of one but I have, you know, advisors and a couple of contractors I'm working with so like being able to have more resources is appealing to me, able to have expertise, perhaps expertise that I don't currently have is helpful as well. The large project teams are less appealing to me, because maybe it's the way this is phrased, but it's the more people there are the more that can be lost in translation and knowing what they're talking about as interview insights and experiment insights. I worry that having that dispersed over so many people will actually dilute the quality of insights you get because there's so many people that need to communicate with one another. Okay.  1  Speaker 1  17:21        Yeah, okay, that's really good. Thank you. So after going through, I think this is the entire page. Yeah. So would you be inclined to get started? If yes, would you be willing to tell us details? If not, can you share what's holding you back?  2  Speaker 2  17:40        Um, based on just this, I would say not yet. I need to learn more. Specifically, I would want to know what does experimentation mean, and what are the price points? Okay.  1  Speaker 1  17:55  Okay, so we're at closing ready. Thank you so much for your insights and feedback. This has been immensely valuable. Please let me know if you have any other thoughts or questions about the process. We truly appreciate your time.  2  Speaker 2  18:09  No problem. This was fine. Thanks for reaching out and for help. The feedback was helpful.        18:14  Really was okay.        18:16  I am what is? Pardon? Can you tell me what the company is?  1  Speaker 1  18:22  Oh, you told me not to. Yeah, I'm sorry.

And we'll have to see right so like if you ask me in two weeks, I might be like, well, all that mitigations. Still, at the end of the day, I built a product that no one wants, but I'm very hopeful that I'm at least avoiding some obvious pitfalls. Because of the testing and discovery I've done. We'll have to see once it launches, what that response is and then where to iterate from there. But in terms of, you know, for other, you always want to move faster, but for other startups I've seen, right, I'd went from July to early November. I'm about to launch a beta and I've done a bunch of deep discoveries. Like while I would love to make progress faster, I don't feel like I'm wasting time.  I'm burning cash. I'm not currently taking a salary. So I may, at least for now, so I'm able to really deploy the pitch competition winnings that I have. So I don't feel like I'm wasting money yet. But then always there's a risk of like, you still might be building a product that you need to iterate on because it's a very iterative learning process. So the answer is like kind of for these.

Because, you know, you will be busy in so many things. You know, you just can't get to your next solution. So, for the external company to come and give you a solution would be you know, would be really good for the company.  Yes, I wouldn't want any external company to directly invade in my company and bring solution to the company but I would rather listen to them and you know, have an option for as a yes or no, for this solution. And I would give an it would be nice if, you know, we could all come together and work for the solution, not just external.

Vital Audio,Nyamitse-Calvin Mahinda,Funding stage C - Seed startup,"Vital Audio makes quality healthcare more efficient, affordable, and universally accessible through voice-based cardiac monitoring.",https://vital.audio/,"B2B, B2C",Technology / Healthcare,"He is affiliated with NYU Tandon and the NYU Entrepreneurship Program, and is the CEO and founder of Vital Audio"," Unknown Speaker 6:45   Hello, hi.     Unknown Speaker 6:47   Oh yeah.     Speaker 0 6:49   Good. Um, thank you so much for taking the time to do this interview. I'm Olivia. I'm a student at NYU and I'm part of this research team for this new product that's under development. So I was wondering like as a founder, I came across your startup on the NYU website because I was looking at NYU startups and I was like, really like inspired by that idea. That was super innovative and interesting. So I was wondering if I could get your insights on this product that we're developing? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Okay. Um, so it's primarily a website. Um, I can send you a link to the website and hear     Unknown Speaker 7:37   what school are you with?     Unknown Speaker 7:40   I go to NYU.     Speaker 1 7:41   What what school is attendant or,     Unknown Speaker 7:44   Oh, I'm in CIS. Actually, I'm doing data science.     Unknown Speaker 7:47   Okay, nice. All right.     Speaker 0 7:49   Let's so is it alright, if I record this interview just for like personal reference looking? Okay, awesome. Thank you. recording in progress. And if you have the option to share your screen, that would also be awesome.     Speaker 1 8:06   All right. Looking for me to share my screen. Yeah.     Speaker 0 8:17   Okay. Um, so this is the summary or Overview section. of the website. It's the value proposition. At first glance after reading it like what's your overall impression of the message     Speaker 1 8:44   so this is just getting more of like a CRM style of a tool where I'm able to just like, really track all my my engagement during customer discovery, gauge interest and so forth. So more of like, CRM to     Speaker 0 9:08   what aspects of it stand out to you positively or negatively.     Speaker 1 9:14   I do like the building of traction. Not sure what that Intel's I would like more description of like, Intel's, like the testing of the business model a lot. So yeah. Okay.     Speaker 0 9:30   And then if you scroll down this is the problem section. Yeah, right there. So, it just it discusses like the problems that a startup could face or that people could face. So looking at these phrases, like wasting time or burning cash or building the wrong product, how do they like resonate with you?     Speaker 1 9:55   They carry some weight. Yes, I think one of the things that we've done differently is we've learned on how to scale minimal operations and how to actually just learn new skills or doing things all our processes still internal. So to some extent, it does resonate with us, I think, yeah.     Speaker 0 10:20   Okay, cool. Um, and then, under that is the feature section. There's three different features. deeply understand your target customer, validate your solution with target customers and build traction with your early adopters. And for each paragraph, it kind of goes into what this business is actually going to do to develop and develop these     Speaker 1 10:47   features. How are you developing these features?     Speaker 0 10:52   So there's, it's basically an externship of people who do research. So basically for deeply understand your target customer there would be a team and they interview 50 Plus target customers to give you like the certainty that you need. Okay. Yeah, and then for validate your solution with target customers. Again, like this team would help. Like increase your chances of success through like running those user experiments. And then the last one is build traction with early adopters. Okay, what are your takeaways like negatively or positively from those three?     Speaker 1 11:47   I think it will be an interesting concept. To be quite honest. I think it's a very interesting concept of having like another team do customer discovery. It could be a preference for some, but for me, like when it comes to customer discovery, I use that opportunity to connect more with my potential customers to get to know them, the people that understand them, relatively closer, beyond. So I think it's going to be like a very interesting path because you're putting a third party between the builder and the customer. It's a question of like, how do you bridge those? Because you have if you have just customer, developer or like the founder or like the builder, you have single space, and they can preach that collaboratively. If he's saying,     Speaker 0 13:04   Yeah, so you're saying that third party in the middle of them kind of takes away that personal element? of building that product and connecting with that consumer? Yeah, okay. Yeah, I completely understand that.     Speaker 1 13:17   So I think like, you might want to understand like, how do you actually bridge that gap? These two gaps because there's a gap between the developer and the middle and the third party and there's the third party and the customer like, how do you make     Speaker 0 13:36   Yeah, how do you make up for that gap? Like a disconnect between the two groups? Okay, yeah. Um, and then below that there is a social proof section. Do these testimonials or endorsements influenced you in any way? Right there. Yeah, that right above our advantage. Yeah, that's     Unknown Speaker 14:06   okay, that's interesting. Tell me more about it.     Speaker 0 14:15   Um, this is just like, hypothetically, since this product is still under development like which externship clients they would include so basically from asking your insight of these different companies we're seeing like if displaying them would positively or negatively influence your view of wanting to buy the product.     Speaker 1 14:39   Think I'm not sure what the yellow one is.     Speaker 0 14:43   It a social media company Snapchat. Okay.     Speaker 1 14:51   And I think it will depend on the kind of industry or vertical that people are, would be if I'm in the healthcare space, the only one out of those that I would actually like me, let me understand what would be the HP tech ventures but all the others I'm just like, I don't know anything about them. Exactly. Yeah. It has to be. It has to resonate with the people that you're engaging.     Speaker 0 15:26   Yeah. Yeah, depending on the field that they're in or what they're interested in. Yeah.     Speaker 1 15:32   I'm heavily rooted within the technology. And like for me, I would say like, for the company that for our company, I'd say Beats by Dre and HP because we deal with a lot of audio bits by some of the aspects of our technology includes voice cancellation and whatnot. So be interested to understand a lot more from their side of the ingenuity of but social media, I don't know much energy innovation capital. Interesting because each company has to have like an ESG aspect of it. So I think that could resonate with all the key players, whether they're healthcare whether they're the to see whether they're b2b, it resonates with them because there's a huge component of like, company identity, plus the ESG aspect of it so that but the others I don't the to social media, I'm not very sure. Yeah. Okay.     Speaker 0 16:42   Awesome. And then the last section is the our advantage section. So it kind of just lays out the three main advantages and summarizes like, what it really is doing. Um, what is your initial reaction to these advantages? And are there any positive or negatives that you take away? from it?     Unknown Speaker 17:05   I do you love the aspect of     Speaker 1 17:14   and that's the other thing, which I think like, yes. Would I love to have like a fully managed project? Yes. When it comes to my customer discovery, another aspect of it is there's a specific kind of like rabbit hole sometimes that we have to go into that goes again to the industry expertise, like, if cetera, if I'm talking to someone and we're talking about readmissions or vi based system of like, how do we funnel patients from the hospital and making sure that we're preventing them from going back to hospital within 30 days? There's a lot of components and so dynamics. Yeah. There's a lot of dynamics and there's a lot of key players from insurance companies. To your doctor that actually sees the patience to everyone, all the bits and pieces have to actually add up for the picture to make clear     Speaker 0 18:27   sense. Yeah, I see what you're saying. Um, it requires a certain level of industry expertise in order to be able to do these things. And obviously, since you are the founder, like you have that and a team of other individuals might not have that experience you have in order to carry out these certain tests. Okay, um, and then there's a Get Started button would you be inclined to get started     Unknown Speaker 18:57   with with I think I wouldn't be opposed to trying it. I wouldn't be opposed to trying it for sure. Yeah.     Speaker 0 19:10   All right. So overall, that's the end of the website. What's your impression of it? Are there any like in general positives or negatives that you took away from it, or feedback?     Speaker 1 19:23   It's clear about the product. I would encourage you a lot more on the customer discovery. It gets tricky. A lot of people a lot of investors a lot of founders prefer to connect that one to one relationship with their customers. Because as an early stage founder, you have to know that it's Murphy's Law. something can go wrong, trust me will go wrong. And you want to have a foster relationship with these keepers or early adopters, that you have an understanding of resolution, maintenance and so forth and so on how you conduct I won't lie to you like my first four elderlies I text them we all want to be like texting buddies. Yeah, text them like they're my friends know each other for years. But these are people that I met either this year or last year. It's not that it's not that I don't want to act actually like so that I don't have any viable thing to do, but I check in with them because I am fostering that relationship. Okay, it can mature and evolve and I can actually go back and say like, Hey, exactly. I know we were we discussed that. We're going to have API's ready for q3. And we've run into these problems. Do you mind and like, this is a good scenario that I'm actually sharing with you I had my first customer. 4 million patients. We are collaborating and I had four weeks to actually complete API's to actually integrate into their system. Four weeks is a very, very, very short time develop. And I thought I was going to lose this customer. They called me at 5am One, one of the past two weeks and they offered me a contract. Or was it is the aspect of me collaborating with them like checking in like, Hey, we are running behind on this. We're doing this we're doing this we got hiccups here. We got hiccups there like being connected and informed with them closely.     Unknown Speaker 22:10   can lead to new opportunities and connections.     Speaker 1 22:14   You have to understand that when it comes to fostering these relationships, like when I have a partnership, especially one of the early stage things that we do is more partnerships up so that you can get to enter in several other doors. That's how we actually navigate the market. You have to understand that, by me winning a contract. My partner also wins a contract meaning that if I scored a contract for 2 million patients tomorrow, the partner who gave me 4 million patients access they also win because they're also getting in more patients to actually keep them at home, and so forth by using our technology. Yeah, in further benefits. Yeah. So it's, it's not a unilateral relationship. There's like, it goes both ways. Okay, yeah. We have to be able to demonstrate that because most people would always ask like so how do I balance is how do I actually go between these two? Yeah.     Speaker 0 23:29   I will say, okay, yeah, that's definitely really good feedback. So you're basically saying, to try to display how you would bridge that gap, and keep that connection going. Even though there is a third party doing the extra work like how would that third party still make sure that you're staying connected with early adopters or customers and stuff like that?     Speaker 1 23:53   Yeah, I think for like a major or like a well, a startup that is probably within series a or so that's something that is easily executable. The reason I'm saying that is I've actually seen that I've worked in startup space for the past six years I have seen early stage how the CEOs, the CEO, or the CFOs prefer to actually have a one to one relationship with the customers. And when it's time that would actually just like, you know what we're going to actually have community members be part of the companies meeting or board meetings so that they can actually chime in and that's how they actually account for customer discovery. So these are areas so you have to understand, like, What size are you actually looking to what size of a startup are you actually looking to because when you say when you say like I deeply understand your customer. I'm like at what stage Am I at precede early stage precede and the stakes are at the stage. When you get to series A you're not at the stage but like, where do I actually fall under this category?     Speaker 0 25:18   And you're saying depending on what stage you are precede or seed stage, it like how you understand your customer is different based on each stage. Very different. Because like as the scale increases, then your view has to kind of widen.     Speaker 1 25:37   Yeah, think of it as a rubber band. Is if I put two people if I put three people in yes, they can fit but you want to have more room for people to actually get to know each other. The more you actually expanded the more the progress is made. The more the thinner the person gets stretched. So yeah, won't have the same bandwidth. We are a seed stage. And my bandwidth today is ridiculous like I run in a week I have close to 50 ad meetings and on top of that, I have to account for customer discovery. So it's not like work we have to always be on the go. How do you actually breach that? How do you bring that back to the founders to being able to function and carry out that task? So that's     Speaker 0 26:42   because yeah, as size increases, like, it also is harder to stay connected, like with your customers and like especially if the amount of customers is increasing like how do you maintain that?     Unknown Speaker 26:53   Yeah, exactly.     Speaker 0 26:57   Um, but other than that, that was the end of the website. I don't think I have any more questions but um, thank you so much for the feedback and insights that was super valuable. Yeah, absolutely.     Speaker 1 27:11   Let me know when Yeah, I think for the technical work would be if you're selling into a more sophisticated industry, healthcare space, we need to understand more of like, a lot of additional dynamics behind like the customer and their ability to pay and so forth, requires like additional additional heavy lifting that otherwise we wouldn't be able to get it in a traditional way. But doing like a technical work if I have my if I actually you should talk to my CTO. You should talk to my CTO probably have like, Okay, if I can have someone go and do my work of like understanding what do I need as far as building this product behind the scene API's because that's the small main component for us CEOs. Our work goes directly into interfacing with customers, and we don't have any shortcuts and I don't think there's any shortcut that we can actually take. So we have to maintain these relationships very intimately. But for a technical team, if they need information on like, how do we how do we build the front end? Or how do we build the infrastructure or how do we use these tools to actually scale our product, then you're giving them the tools to be successful and to deliver to Yeah,     Speaker 0 28:55   so it's almost the service is definitely more beneficial towards the technical than the social side.

Would I love to have like a fully managed project? Yes. When it comes to my customer discovery, another aspect of it is there's a specific kind of like rabbit hole sometimes that we have to go into that goes again to the industry expertise, like, if cetera, if I'm talking to someone and we're talking about readmissions or vi based system of like, how do we funnel patients from the hospital and making sure that we're preventing them from going back to hospital within 30 days?

To your doctor that actually sees the patience to everyone, all the bits and pieces have to actually add up for the picture to make clear. ", N/A ," They carry some weight. Yes, I think one of the things that we've done differently is we've learned on how to scale minimal operations and how to actually just learn new skills or doing things all our processes still internal.

I would encourage you a lot more on the customer discovery. It gets tricky. A lot of people a lot of investors a lot of founders prefer to connect that one to one relationship with their customers. Because as an early stage founder, you have to know that it's Murphy's Law. something can go wrong, trust me will go wrong. And you want to have a foster relationship with these keepers or early adopters, that you have an understanding of resolution, maintenance and so forth and so on how you conduct I won't lie to you like my first four elderlies I text them we all want to be like texting buddies. Yeah, text them like they're my friends know each other for years. But these are people that I met either this year or last year. It's not that it's not that I don't want to act actually like so that I don't have any viable thing to do, but I check in with them because I am fostering that relationship. Okay, it can mature and evolve and I can actually go back and say like, Hey, exactly. I know we were we discussed that. We're going to have API's ready for q3. And we've run into these problems. Do you mind and like, this is a good scenario that I'm actually sharing with you I had my first customer. 4 million patients. We are collaborating and I had four weeks to actually complete API's to actually integrate into their system. Four weeks is a very, very, very short time develop. And I thought I was going to lose this customer. They called me at 5am One, one of the past two weeks and they offered me a contract. Or was it is the aspect of me collaborating with them like checking in like, Hey, we are running behind on this. We're doing this we're doing this we got hiccups here. We got hiccups there like being connected and informed with them closely. "," Recommendations can be quoted in the paragraph above. To sum up his recommendations though, he said to improve the specifics of how the service is being provided/carried out, and specifically how this service would bridge the gap between the disconnection that a third party doing a company's work can create.

Is there anything you're maybe like taking away from this section? Is there anything that's maybe like standing out to you?     Speaker 2 3:15   Oh, yeah, of course. I take away the idea that the service is not just about building a product, but about ensuring that it fits the market, something very important for startups. The mention of an externship suggests a hands on immersive approach, and that I think, is very valuable.     Speaker 1 3:33   Okay, yeah. Definitely.

Okay, thank you. Um, great.     Speaker 1 6:16   So, the first question I have for you is with the wasting time problem you see right there. So how does the phrase wasting time how does that resonate with you?     Speaker 2 6:31   Wasting time is a constant war in the startup you're always rushing to get the best experience for your customers and you can't really afford to lose a moment. You know, time is money as they say. Definitely. Yeah.     Speaker 1 6:47   Great. Thank you for that. Moving on to the next statement burning cash. I'd love to know how this specific statement also just resonates with you and your personal experiences as a founder.     Speaker 2 7:00   This is a real concern. And when you're in the early stages of a startup, you need to be careful not to overspend because resources are always tight. And usually, your funds and your resources are just enough to make your development work. Right. Definitely there's not     Speaker 1 7:23   much of like that leeway there that you like see with like other Korean companies, for sure. Yeah. Thank you for that input. And yeah, so the last term I just would love to know more about like your aspects on is building the wrong product. So in terms of like this statement right here, have you ever faced any challenges in that? area with with your company or your product?     Speaker 2 7:52   Of course I have, it's, it's a very common pitfall for startups. Because sometimes you think you're on the right track, but the market says otherwise. And it's just a learning process. You know, it's gonna happen to everyone eventually. But it seems very helpful if there really is a tool to like help you avoid that. Yeah, so perfect.     Speaker 1 8:17   So thank you so much for your insights in this area. So moving on, if you scroll down, you'll see that we have the Features section right here.

So I'll give you a minute to just read through these this feature section right here. And yeah, if you have any thoughts you want to share out loud, just initially, feel free to do so. Or we can just move on and I will have some questions for you about this feature section. If that's okay.     Unknown Speaker 8:58   Okay, well let me just switch to this. Gotcha.     Speaker 2 9:39   Okay. I don't really have any questions for you. I think we just, I just rather move on to the questions that you have to ask me. Okay. Sounds good.     Speaker 1 9:49   So, if you don't have any questions, the let's just dive into the features then. So the first feature right here deeply understand your target customer. The question I have for you right now initially is just how do you feel about the need to deeply understand your customer and like What's your understanding of this feature?     Speaker 2 10:14   I mean, deeply understanding your customer is really crucial for your startup. Like, this is who you're gonna sell your product to. But it is easier said than done, and I am very curious on how they plan to achieve this. Okay, gotcha. So,     Speaker 1 10:36   so, just to get you correctly, so are you kind of like, cloudy on where like how this specific products would really kind of like help the startup founders target those customers? Yes, gotcha.     Unknown Speaker 10:52   Okay. Um,     Speaker 1 10:53   so the next question I have for you about this feature right here is Is there anything that appeals to you about this feature? If yes, I'd love to know what appeals to you or maybe like if there's some parts that don't appeal to you? I'd love to hear your thoughts on that as well.     Speaker 2 11:10   The appeal is the scale of insight on the market. I think the idea of conducting like 50 plus interviews with target customers suggests a thorough and comprehensive approach. But I am skeptical about like managing such a large scale externship effectively. Okay, so     Speaker 1 11:35   yeah, definitely. There are some like questions that arrive there like maybe like, with like, such a large scale like you mentioned, like how could this be done like effectively like how do we know each like specific sectors like being properly managed, especially with such a large scale, so that definitely does some questions do come to mind there. So thank you for that. I can like move on to the next feature here. If you don't have any follow up questions for me.     Speaker 2 12:06   I think the features might the the features might answer my concern. So let's move on to that. Okay. Um,     Speaker 1 12:18   so the next feature here is validate your solution with target customers. So again, the question I just have for you right off the bat is what is your understanding of this feature that the that the website is talking about?     Speaker 2 12:38   I'd say that validating the solution is everything for your product. It's about making sure what we're building resonates with our target audience. You know, it's not just about having a cool idea. It's about ensuring it solves a real problem for our customers. For sure. Yeah.     Speaker 1 12:56   Definitely. Thank you for that, and I'm going off of that. I'm going off of your answer. I'd love to know, again. Are there aspects of this feature that are appealing to you or Are there aspects that are appealing to you? What are your thoughts there?     Speaker 2 13:15   Of the appeal is in mitigating the risk of building something that nobody wants. We've had instances, like in my line of work, where we thought we had the next big thing but the market just didn't agree. So having a process of validate our solution, before going all in is very crucial, in my opinion. Definitely. Yeah.     Speaker 1 13:38   Thank you. So yeah, definitely. So yeah, it seems like this feature is definitely one that's kind of like standing out and is definitely important. If I'm getting that correct.     Speaker 2 13:49   You are it is very important. And just something that is very much needed. And it seems like it'd be really helpful. Yeah, for sure.     Speaker 1 14:01   Thank you. Yeah, that's what I thought too. And I like was really into this definitely does seem helpful. Um, great. So we can move on to the last feature here. So the last feature is build traction with early adopters. So I'd love to know what your initial like understanding of this feature was when after you read through that after you read through the little description there.     Speaker 2 14:30   I'd say building traction with early adopters is critical in the startup world. It's about getting those initial customers who are willing to try your product and provide feedback and just essentially become your advocates. Yeah, um, yeah,     Speaker 1 14:48   I really like what you mentioned there, you know, your customers really are, you know, like those people who are willing to try your product or customers, they really are gonna be the biggest advocates for your product, whatever that might be. So definitely, yeah, so thank you for that. And for this specific feature, what appealed to you about it or what didn't?     Speaker 2 15:12   The appeal is of course a man's. Early adopters are like your first supporters. They validate your idea and they help you refine your product. It's, it's a crucial step in gaining and market acceptance. Just it's not always as easy to identify and attract the right early adopters. It just, I feel like it requires a solid strategy to engage and retain them. Yeah, so     Speaker 1 15:40   definitely, that's definitely true. I'd even think about that. So yeah, it's just like not like you can have any customer audience to be those advocates like you mentioned earlier. You do need that solid strategy and maybe like this product can really help you with that. So just based on the website right now, what what's your overall impression or understanding of this like products yet? You're gaining from this website.     Speaker 2 16:13   The website suggests that they can help in acquiring early adopters to the product market fit access ship. And that that was That does sound promising. I'd like to dig deeper into their approach like how they define and target early adopters and what strategies they recommend for building and sustaining that initial traction. Definitely. So those are just some very important things. And I would personally like to know their strategy for all of them. For sure. Yeah. So just     Speaker 1 16:46   kind of like getting more clear about how like all these features that the product is encapsulating how exactly they're going about doing these basically. Yes, indeed. Okay. Well, thank you so much for your insights on the features they're moving on. If you do scroll down here, yep, right there.

So after viewing these endorsements, how does that how does this like section right here really influenced your view of the product now if it if it did change it?     Speaker 2 17:34   They influenced my view positively, I'd say seeing I profile clients like these. It just gives me confidence that it gives me confidence in the products credibility, and it suggests that the service has been beneficial to companies in various industries. I don't think there's a better vouch for your product than high profile clients endorsing it. Yeah, definitely. And I like     Speaker 1 18:03   what you mentioned about the various industries they're, you know, like you have like energy innovation capital and then like, you have like Snapchat right there. So you have like energy and then like tech also. So yeah, the fact that there's like, lots of like a vast array of industries as well as something that was interesting to me as well. So thank you for your inputs there. Yeah. So thank you again. So now, below that, we have the advantages section and I'll give you some time again to just read through these advantages here. And then if you have any thoughts, again, feel free to share them, but if not, I have some questions for you about this section.     Speaker 3 18:47   All right. Just let me read through it for a second. Yeah, go for it.     Speaker 2 19:13   All right. I'm ready for a question. Okay. Perfect. Thank     Speaker 1 19:17   you so much. I'm so so so now we've moved on to the advantages and the first one here is fully managed. So I'd love to just know your initial reaction to this advantage here.     Speaker 2 19:33   Being fully managed, it's a significant advantage for me, because as a founder, I wear hats. So having a service that takes care of the entire process is very appealing. Yeah, definitely.     Speaker 1 19:47   Definitely. I know. I know. Some like startup founders myself, like one of my friends, the startup founder, and yeah, definitely wearing those multiple hats is definitely that's something that I've seen as well. So that would be a great advantage there. So thank you for your thoughts on that. And just going off of that what you just shared, is this something that is this advantage, something that you see as important or valuable to you? And I'd love to know why.     Speaker 2 20:17   Absolutely. It just allows me to focus on other critical aspects of the business, while knowing about a product market fit an externship is being handled efficient, efficiently. Yeah.     Speaker 1 20:32   Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. So, yeah, so I guess we can move on to the next advantage then. So the next advantage here we're looking at is expert lead. So same questions again. So I'd love to again know your initial reaction to this advantage.     Speaker 2 20:53   Expert lead is also quite an appealing, just advantage because having industry veterans leading the project, I'd say it brings a level of expertise and insight that can be invaluable, especially in navigating challenges specific to our industry. Yeah, for sure.     Speaker 1 21:15   Definitely. Thank you for that. I like what you said there about like how, you know, like, all of the different expertise you get from different areas is definitely invaluable. So going off of that. Again, is this is this something that you see is this advantage something you see being important to you or valuable and I'd love to know why or why not?     Speaker 2 21:43   Of course, in the startup world, every decision you make cows, and having seasoned experts guiding the project can significantly enhance the quality of insight we gained. And I'd say it's not just about data collection. It's about having someone who has been through similar journeys, providing strategic input, and that just that level of experience alone can be a game changer. For a startup like ours. Yeah, okay.     Speaker 1 22:15   That's great. That's great that that's something like I would really be like beneficial for your specific startup. That's cool to know. So what advantage here I have is large teams. Yeah, I'd love to just learn more about like your initial reaction to this advantage. And if you if this is something that you would that you see important for your company     Speaker 2 22:45   my initial reaction is a mixture of curiosity and interest. I mean, having 100 person team working on the externship seems like a significant scale and it just it could potentially mean a broader range of expertise and faster execution. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, so     Speaker 1 23:09   yes, like, just like hop on that like, as you mentioned, that, like the broader range and the faster execution so is that something that you would find like valuable to you and your company personally?     Speaker 2 23:26   I would say that it is definitely important, because in a startup time is of the essence and just having a larger team can can mean much quicker results, you know, definitely a diverse team just brings various perspectives and it just can be so valuable in tackling complex challenges. But for me, it does raise some questions about coordination and communication within such a large team. Like to, like how do they ensure everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goals? That's just something I would want to explore further and very curious about how it works with such a large scale team. Yeah, for sure. Yeah,     Unknown Speaker 24:19   thank you. for that.

Very cool. So, we, you know, while we go back to the top there, here, what's your overall impression of this message, accelerate product market fit, you know, whatever you're seeing here in the first view, what's your overall impression of that message?     Speaker 0 15:49   So, what's deeply understand your customer validate? I guess from going through it really quickly, I understood it as they I guess this this this company is to help people who are trying to increase their their client or customer portfolio or database and they help them come up with a way to basically attract more customers. How to come up with a solution to do that and how to stay consistent.     Speaker 1 16:24   Amazing what stands out to you positively and negatively.     Speaker 0 16:32   All think that there's anything negative about it? I feel like if if you're a business that is definitely in need, like you have your things figured out and you've been trying things out on your own, and you're in need of a team to come in. I don't understand the term externship. That's a bit different to me. Like I don't know what that means. externship. Like, take your runway by launching a product fit externship. I don't understand what you meant by that. But um, what they mean here but I think he can maybe like clarify, or help me understand what, what that means. But I don't think that there's anything negative about it is like if you need to help if you need customers, or in your startup, and it's true that a lot of startups they fail because they don't have the resources or the understanding of how to build their business. If this is the team that can provide those kinds of resources and I think it's great.     Speaker 1 17:37   That is great inside also what I know you said that you don't understand what externship means. You see the word and you think of the word what comes to mind. What do you think of it?     Speaker 0 17:52   It's like somebody doing an internship externally. I don't know. Like, I think that's what I think about, but I've never, I've never known about externships. I've just known about internships. Particular went away by launching a product market fit externship. Yeah, it's lost. I'm lost on that one. Sorry.     Speaker 1 18:22   To get your feedback, this is really good for us. Does it resonate does anything resonates with a particular message or challenges that you're currently facing as a business?     Speaker 0 18:37   I would think the top here is definitely I resonate with like with the stop wasting time burning cash building the wrong product. Because I myself find myself going back to the drawing board and figuring out my business may be different than what other businesses are out there. It's really just, we're a production studio. So it's like, what we're trying to do is our services are like photography, videography, using our expertise and, and packaging, packaging that as a product that people want to purchase is that it's as easy as like somebody coming to me and they're like, Hey, can you help me with my social media or my brand or the kind of content that I put out, and that's what SK II studios would be about. But we are a team of two people. We are understaffed. We're not in that place where we can hire more folks to get the business going. So it's really sort of just like networking through word of mouth, and, and also not tapping into the resources that are available to us as a black business as a queer business. There are grants and things out there that I'm sure that we can use, but we're funding a lot of our projects ourselves. And the impact and the impact and the results of a lot of our projects. Sometimes we feel like we're not getting back a lot of the effort that we put into them so it was like that resonates with me a lot like I understand the problem, but as a business Am I in a place where I feel like I'm ready to to do an externship whatever that means, I would say no only because I don't know what that means fully. We we staff your externship with 100 person teams like are they Is it a staffing company? Are they looking for more people to work for SKU studio? You know what I'm saying? Those are the kinds of questions that I have.     Speaker 1 20:35   Okay, great questions. Great questions. Those are the questions that we'll use to be able to, you know, better improve, or product times or provide you with those answers. And you spoke about your problems already. And how those you know, key phrases resonated with you. Where you see, the deeper understand your target customer, are you able to go to that section for more means them What What, What's your understanding of this feature in itself? And what appealed to you about it?     Speaker 0 21:22   I like that it's about knowing your audience. For the product that you have. There is a particular market for it. There's a market for everything and so, understanding your market, what their needs are and how to tailor your products in ways that will they will find value in them is what I understand from this. So it's like it says is the same thing as understanding your audience understanding your target customers because once you have a targeted strategy, a product that is for that particular audience or market then you're going to be successful versus just putting something out that is something they might not necessarily need.     Speaker 1 22:09   Interesting, that's very good insight. Also for the social proof section where you see the branded companies, are you able to scroll down just a little bit down Yeah. Where you see the Tick Tock logo, etc. How do these testimonials are just a snapshot? Yes, yes. How do these testimonials or endorsements influenced your view of the product? itself?     Speaker 0 22:47   I think it's really cool that they were working with these people. I just wish I knew what externship meant. Like, are they like how it's it doesn't necessarily tell me how they're partnering with with these companies. But I do think that there are big companies that have on there like HP. I'm familiar with Beats by Dre. That's awesome. I don't know what the magic is. And I don't know what energy innovation capital is. I'm sure it's like some some hedge fund. But that's about it. I think it's cool that a couple of them are pretty high. What do you call them, like high profile brands?     Speaker 1 23:28   Okay. All right. That's good. That's good. Any other insight that you have or feedback regarding the overall you know, while you are going through it any anything else that you want to add?     Speaker 0 23:45   Maybe a little bit message about about the team members that are here. I was trying to click and try to read a little bit about them. If not, I would probably have to like search them up online or going to LinkedIn. I think this is cool. It's like it's great to know what their titles are and how they contribute to the team but it's like, like, I don't have any information as to what they do. Specifically on the team. And that's about it. I think it's clear. I love the simplicity of the page. It's easy to follow through but maybe the maybe how you're how you're sharing you know how you're kind of like providing that information could be a bit more clear. For me as somebody who just doesn't understand what this is, specifically, but somebody else might understand. I don't know.     Speaker 1 24:49   I think your insights are quite valuable and I really do. You know, I agree with you on that point as well something back to the team to be able to enhance that and bring back and bring that to the forefront on what you have seen and the challenges or the problems that you see your business wanting to face wanting to address wanting to improve even though it's just the two of you, would you be inclined to get started as well. You know, will you be you know, willing to input your details for further information. For     Speaker 0 25:26   further information, yes, if it's just like informational, but not ready to make any sort of just like financial commitment or anything if that's what that means.

We truly appreciate your time. Of course. Amazing All right, so I'm going to cut the recording now. Don't just as yet okay.

"," The pain the resonate with the interviewee most is wasting time and  burning cash to build the wrong product because they are figuring out their product market fit by going back to the opportunity board to understand what is the business model or service trying to solve, type of packaging and resources that will be utilized to make a valuable market fit product to solve consumers ongoing needs.

Slate,"Enrique Moran, Sophie Berger, and Calum Woznow","Stage A, Pre-Seed",They currently have a waitlist but it is an add-on for your keyboard using AI to make your jobs/tasks easier.,https://www.getslate.ai/,B2C,Slate AI,"Sophie Berger is a co-founder and the CTO of Slate, she graduated at UBC with Masters in Management. She highly is interested in the usage of Artificial Intelligence and the various ways it can improve areas of life.", <a href=https://otter.ai/u/lX6ruW3L9PC4EyxRahPUxeofmu4?utm_source=copy_url rel=noopener noreferrer target=_blank>https://otter.ai/u/lX6ruW3L9PC4EyxRahPUxeofmu4?utm_source=copy_url</a> , Sophia Berger was partially resonated with this section because she didn't fully understand what this section was talking about and what the purpose is of the service is However approves of the readability and the conciseness; she is also intrigued by the points listed on the section. ,,," I like the second bullet point. I don't have anything negative to say about that.  I really like it. It's very short, simple sentences. It brings the point across. It doesn't go on for paragraphs and paragraphs.  The issues that you address kind of speak to me as a startup founder. It makes a lot of sense. These are very common problems that are very important to address and are key to having a successful business.     The logo is very big, it's very in your face, and kind of takes away from the actual words and content that are here.  For the first bullet point, as a startup founder, I want to be involved in this process because it is so important to the identity of the company.  I don't think that more results, being faster is necessarily better. I would say that less results that are of higher quality and have more insights are probably better than just having a lot of results but don't actually show you a very clear pattern. ",," I like the beginning of it. With a lot of the points, like you have limited resources, your team is understaffed.     I like that a lot. I think most of those are relatable, especially at an early-stage startup.     I also liked the way that it's laid out because if I look at the section, the way that I read it is I go, I read the problem first, then I read stop, but then I read the bullet points, and then I read the paragraph.     So even if for whatever reason I don't have the attention or like the patience to read the paragraph, just reading the bullet points already gives me a good idea of what it's saying.     I think the layout is really good, and the message comes across. "," However, with these pain points, I can summarize that is Sophie partially resonating with the Problem section (Wasting time, Burning Cash, Building the wrong product and appreciated the layout and clarity. However, she gives constructive feedback about the section within itself. It may grab the attention of the clients. However, some of the information may create discourse because Sophie thought it could be demeaning to clients. "," For example, when it says your team is understaffed, in my mind, I'm thinking, 'Actually, no, we're not understaffed. This doesn't really relate to me.'     Concerns about the term unit help and its potential implications of a power imbalance. ", There isn't any explicit feedback with the Problem Resonance because she was very focused on the overarching information that was residing in the problem section. ," both like and hate the unit help. I like it because it definitely catches your attention. It makes you feel like, 'Do I need help? Like maybe I do,' but at the same time, it's kind of like not demeaning, but it sounds almost like you're sick or something.     It might be better to be like you need support or something that has less of a power imbalance, but more of like, 'Okay, let's do this together "," Sophie partially resonated with this section because she is starting to understand the concept of the externship as following along. She also found issues with the layout, and it didn't seem clear enough what was trying to get across. "," Sophie resonated well with this section, and she exclaimed how Validation of Target Customers explains how an extern helps. However, she partially resonates with the need to distinguish when understanding the client what the solution is right for them and how this service can accomplish this goal. "," Sophie Berger positively resonates with the section on building traction with adopters. She recognizes its significance in connecting various aspects of product and customer validation, highlighting the importance of following the correct consumers with the right solution. There are constructive comments about challenges related to consumer conversations and the need for incentives, but these are framed more as considerations rather than explicit negatives. ",," I would say generally positive resonance with the social proof section, admiring the credibility added by showcasing big, well-known companies. However, there is constructive feedback regarding potential confusion in presenting external clients and a suggestion to include more early-stage startups in the list for better representation. So I would say she would go onto the website since these companies are pretty widely known. "," Sophie resonates positively with the short and clear sentences in the advantage section, addressing common problems for startup founders. However, there are concerns about the size of the logo being distracting and reservations about the importance of founders' involvement in the process and the emphasis on speed over quality. ", I would say maybe because she had some reservations about the service. A lot of it was due to the content and its layout. ,"<ul><li>I feel like it's kind of repetitive because I just read the same things before I clicked on the get started button.</li><li>I think having more emphasis on the fact that the control is still with the startup founders and they can still have as much control as they want to.</li><li>They can choose to have a minimal time commitment and really have most of the control be in their hands.</li><li>The less text you can have in the section, the better.</li><li>I would remove this text, just keep the heading, and then just have the form with a submit button and make it very simple.</li><li>I think this is good data to collect for sure.</li><li>I feel like it complicates the whole form.

The thing is, we used a platform called HubSpot to solve such problems. We need to just wing it with marketing because marketing is obviously expensive and getting actual on-field research is also very expensive, if you are a startup in particular. So what we used to do is we used to just wing it and we used to just throw arrows into the dark and see hoping for one arrow to land properly. So that is where I think this company can help a lot of startups. It is if this is economically done on a small budget that a startup can accommodate, I think this is a very nice solution.  "," I think it's very personal to do something like this. And to make a deal with a company or something like this, it is very personal. I wouldn't do it just because Snapchat, did it or I wouldn't do it just because because he did it. They might have their own reasons, but I seriously do not care that much. About the clients that the company has. I just believe in what the company has actually established. So going, going through this, if I see that I would, I would seriously take a look at the company on Google. Like I would just Google the company and see what history it has, what background it has and how effective the company has been engendered, regardless of the clients that it has. ",  I don't know what project they're talking about. It's it's a little vague. , WRONG PRODUCT ," Yeah, wasting time and burning cash are things that every startup initially faces. That's a very common problem. Building the wrong product is where most products most startups don't ever come to the delight of investments or some angel rounds. ", WASTING TIME AND BURNING CASH ,"  Building the wrong product is where most products most startups don't ever come to the delight of investments or some angel rounds. They don't cross that path as well, when they build the wrong product because the industry is dynamics might change or something like that could happen. Which may lead to their vision being wrong.

But the only problem for me is I still don't know what the company is doing ",,, RESONATED , PARTIAL , NOT AT ALL  ,, NO  , PARTIALLY , MAYBE ," So So one insight that I had is the same thing. represent your company more in the website than other brands? Because I can I the only thing that I actually genuinely remember is seeing a Snapchat logo, and an apple logo and a HP logo. I don't remember the company being that this logo is good, but it's in the end I want it to be more represented here. Yeah, I think I would get more information like the information that I'm actually interested in once I fill out the form and seek help from an expert, but I would still like some quantitative analysis of whatever they have already achieved to be in the homepage as well. I in fact, would like it to be the first thing that I see when I open the website. I think everything else looks fine. They could work more on the UI. And I don't know if this actually matters or if if it is even a good insight but these look AI generated I don't know.

There is if there is some if this is a completely new company, I can understand if it doesn't have a history with other instances which will help it develop statistics I can still understand but yeah, here I think that is missing.

"," And then that for me they're mainly like then you connect with as related to the target customers. Like you, for example, you can find the customer collecting feedback, and this is something similar to and then.        For the service part, I think, I think there are good, like there are some pain points that a lot of companies they might face like not be able to find, because especially for some SaaS company or some tech company, or like some of the AI company.        For them, a lot of the startup founder, they might be technicians or people that are not very familiar with the marketing like they maybe they did a product and they think is good, but it is hard for them to find target customers. Yeah, so. So I do think a service is valuable if there's some like actual service, similar service like this... "," Well, for this part is like it's the entire structural. If, well, if, for me, I think the entire website structure could need to change a little bit because like I said, I think it's very important for the clients "," Well, I would say for the advantage maybe it could work could there's some space for the improvements. But then because we don't have enough time. I can give you some direct answers.' ",," Oh, actually, in my opinion, this session is alright is just because after I look, at the entire website, I do see I do believe like, helping people to find the target customer would be a good point.     Yeah. And then I think I think the most important thing to make this website more professional is is the team is about is to demonstrate how professional is the team and what would be the result. ---Why would some other company trust the service right? Yeah "," He didn't really say which was a problem for him. It does mention on his LinkedIn that spending time and money was used to build his app, so I think this is what suggested that this is a problem when it comes to 'Burning Cash' and 'Wasting time'. He was speaking on the problem section, basically finding the targeting companies. He resonated on companies finding their target customers working under a PMF framework. However, he does mention the features section to not waste too much time. ",,,," For 'Deeply Understand Your Customers,' Richard resonated well with this section, he has had some similar experiences as a startup founder and understood this section, but there were things he did not resonate well with. He was very explanatory about what goes into creating a PMF(Product-Market Fit), he was inclined to tell me reasons as to why this section was something he has also had to understand when creating a company. "," For product feature 2, the 'Validate your Solution with Target Customers' resonated well with Richard, he acknowledges the pain points of finding target customers for companies and recognizes service value. He however made some suggestions about the section.  "," Building Traction with Your Early Adopters. Richard expresses positive resonance with the practical aspects of the service, such as finding target customers, conducting interviews, and collecting feedback. However, he suggested improvement in ensuring the information was more specific. The importance of the team's visibility and credibility is also emphasized. "," What I want to see on a website is probably okay. First, this company can help us find, like, maybe 100 target customers, and they can help us do the interview. They can help us to collect the feedback. And they could help us improve the beta version or give some opinions about the product.     How long could you help me to collect how many target customers and how would be the feedbacks? How feedback would be like, and what would be the entire service sort of process that I would want to see... ", Running short on time during the social proof couldn't do it ! ," Richard couldn't get into it due to time restraints; however, he believes that there is some space for improvement from my understanding is that he patrially resonated with it. ", They wouldn't click the button because they need strong credibility and a success story to better fit the startup company as legitimate.  ,,, Richard said he understands the commitment and the amount of hours for a startup company. ," He wanted to see more specifics on each section, mainly on the first section.

So I let you the control now, do what you normally do with a website like this. And you can like think out loud just so I can hear your feedback on each section. Okay, perfect.     Yassine Tabouti  4:18    I mean, right off the start, I think this is interesting. So I'm eager to know more about more customer interviews. I can understand it that it's fully managed.     Speaker 0  4:32    . Okay, so, like, one request, can we go back to the top of the website, and I want to ask you some questions about  each section to see if it resonates with you or not.     Yassine Tabouti  4:56    do I have do I have to see the whole website?      Speaker 0  5:00    just yes if you want to Yes.     Yassine Tabouti  5:03    Just to  get the full idea and then we can discuss     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  5:06    makes sense     Yassine Tabouti  5:17          Okay, so you guys take care of the target customers. Well, that's interesting. Interaction. Yes, I was waiting to see some type of message. I mean, the companies you are already working with so it's nice to see. HP snapshot that's that's good. It's it catches my attention. Okay..     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  6:19    Okay. Okay, so um, when you see like the title and the message and below the title, What's your first impression, and does the message resonates with you?     Yassine Tabouti  6:37    Cool. Currently, at my stage, it does resonate with me. We are at the stage of testing our products. So we have already lost some time. So the term of accelerate  does resonate. I think it's it's very relevant to my to my position at the moment. So I'm interested to see how as a startup, we can accelerate building a market fit product. deeply understand your customer validate your solution, build traction. Just, I think from another side, I think it's it's direct. I was hoping to know more about, for example, validate your solution, how we can do that. Maybe, maybe instead of this picture, we can have a video explaining maybe the steps and more details. Build traction, okay. Just just your business model. I think it's it's a little bit general but I see I see the points from from from this paragraph. I think if it was a paragraph, rather than bullets, I think it's it will have more value in it.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani    7:54    You said you said if there is a video that will be better. So in the in absence of the video What does it make you feel about the product?     Yassine Tabouti  8:08    Um, I can see it's it makes me more curious about it. So it's it goes both ways. I was I was hoping that to see more but at the same time, I'm more interested to see how I can get the help. I have in mind using this your method of accelerating a product market fit.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani   8:28    Okay, perfect. Can you move on to the next section, please? Yes. Okay, so, the three points like 100 customer interview interview is fully managed is a scale like what insights gave you ?     Yassine Tabouti  8:53    I think they're great. I like the idea that it's fully managed. So as a startup, founder or co founder, you have a lot of things on your plate. So it's good to have something outsourced, like fully outsourced so to someone with more experience than me or my my team. When other customer interviews I'm actually interested in this part because currently we are trying to do more interviews at our customer or target audience. So we can we can do more than 20 or 50 Max. So 100 seems something that I'm interested to see if we can if we can, if we can do a number like that. Okay,     Kawtar Ait oulahyani    9:39    Got you. Okay, so, for this section of the problem, when you see it, what do you think?     Yassine Tabouti  9:49    Okay     okay I get the idea, but I think it's it's throwing me in two different directions. I mean, it's 90 startups, okay. To fail. It talks about resources, your team understaffed. It's basically the same thing. You're doing the work you've never done before? Maybe some projects are endless. Whatever caught my attention, is this this site? I think this site is a little bit General. Or it doesn't it doesn't show exactly the problem you guys are offering to help with so I can't I can't I understand the points but it's a bit confusing if I'm being honest. But to be honest, if it's if the solution stops wasting time or burning cash, I'm already interested because like I said early on, we are we already wasted time trying to validate the product. So if it's gonna save our startup time if it's if it's gonna stop us from burning more cash and definitely building the right products. It's it's something that that's interesting to me.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani   11:18    Okay. So which which have a problem that resonates with you more?     Yassine Tabouti  11:28    To be honest, all three of them are irrelevant, but in my specific case, I think if if I get a solution that stops that some wasting process in my startup at the moment, I think the first the first problem catches my attention more. Okay,     Kawtar Ait oulahyani    11:47    perfect. I'm going Can we jump to the to the other section, please? Yes. So in this section, when you see what do yu think?     Yassine Tabouti  12:05    I mean, right, right off the bat. I can I can understand what's what you gonna help me with. Apart from this paragraph before I think this is more clear of a statement. How do we would in customer     Yes, so this this sentence speaks directly to me because we tried to do many interviews, but we can't seem to do more than 510 interviews. So I believe this. This sentence or this paragraph speaks directly to me because we need more interviews at the moment to better understand our target customers and and build the product fit for them. I'm a little bit thrown off by a product market fits. Excuse me Market Fit externship. This sentence to be exact, because obviously, we spoke so I understand the concept of externship, but before it's the first time I've heard about it, so I was hoping to see more. Maybe more education about a product fit. externship. What does it mean? What value does it hold for a startup? So, but I can see I can see what it does. Specific specifically that it's relatable to my to my institution at the moment. So, more interviews, it's something that speaks directly to my needs at the moment.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani    13:44    Makes sense?     Yassine Tabouti  13:47    Yeah. I was hoping to get more information about it, but overall this this paragraph is direct and to the point. Okay,        Kawtar Ait oulahyani    13:57    can you go please to the next point.     Yassine Tabouti  14:02    Okay. This one yes. What is that your solution?     Kawtar Ait oulahyani   14:28    Okay, so um, is there something that doesn't resonate with you or doesn't make sense true or with what you're experiencing?     Yassine Tabouti  14:49    Get a product. F  First of all, I think it's great. It speaks to my needs at the moment. What is your solution with target customers? Again, I was hoping to see more about the process of validation maybe thinking we can do this step and then next step and then the next step. But But overall, I resonate with at my stage, I don't think it's expensive. But again, I'm speaking from my my situation because I have a service based startup. We don't need a lot of capital at the beginning. Maybe if we can branch into paid media or paid ads, but the bidding of products at the beginning in my case, I don't think it's expensive, but I think it's time costly. So I was hoping to see or maybe, if, if it's mentioned that it's also time expensive, not only cost expensive. I think it would speak to me even more okay.        Kawtar Ait oulahyani    16:06    You can move  okay.     Yassine Tabouti  16:15    Build Traction     This spot specifically speaks to me because as a start up, you know, at the beginning  you test more of more of more or less you test to see which channel is most effective for your offer. Until you get the right channel the right messaging. So it's I think it's going to be ideal if we can, as a start up, get a framework how to choose the perfect channel before the testing because testing like I said before, it takes a lot of time it takes a lot of costs. So it will be very beneficial to to maybe get a framework of of how we can get an ideal acquisition channel for my target audience. Which will eventually build more traction     As a marketer only relates heavily with the statements because it's not it's not enough to build a solution you have to build attraction. So I think it's these two paragraphs this one deeply understand your target customer and this one, I think that they are very detailed they show what the externship is going to offer so I'm impressed with this one.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  18:11    Okay, any other thoughts or something that didn't line with you?     Yassine Tabouti  18:32    Think the value proposition is a little bit vague. I mean, I'm speaking from the perspective as being the first maybe a stumbled upon this website. So if I read launch a product market fit externship. I would be a little bit confused but curious to understand what first of all what does externship or a product market fit externship means in to begin acquire early adopters and how I'm going to begin acquiring early adopters. So maybe the education part, I was told I was maybe hoping to see more more education about this part. Okay.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  19:19    Let’s jump to the next section please. Yes. So how does this testimonials make you feel about the product?     Yassine Tabouti  19:33    To be honest, it's it says that the solution is already ongoing. It's not something in the beta stages or just in the testing phase. Seeing big names like Snapshat,Hp. It gives a feeling of credibility I can trust this product. I can maybe give my information for a call. Because you already gained the trust. of big companies.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  20:03    Okay, perfect. So let's move to our inventors. So for each advantage, can you share with me? What resonates with you and what didn't resonate with you? Okay     Yassine Tabouti  20:29    I mentioned this at the beginning. I think this advantage specifically resonates with me in my needs at the moment. I would like for, for a solution to manage the entirety of a project especially it's something that I don't have expertise on it. Which drives me to the second advantage. I think something led by experts it's going to hold a lot of value. I will help you to see maybe our industry veterans, we'll get you the critical insights your company needs. Maybe an introduction to know who are the experts behind this this service or this externship? But, yeah, the idea of having something fully outsourced by experts. Like I said, I'm still at the beginning of my stage so experts knowledge is going to be very helpful. Again, I was hoping to see more more clarity on who, who this industry  are, but overall, I think it's the two different two first are great. Large project teams we separate social puts in person teams in order teams, men or results. Okay. I get the idea that the externship offers a lot of teams, but does it offer a number depending on the size of the startup, maybe?     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  22:05    What do you think based on what you've seen, while scrolling the website?     Yassine Tabouti  22:16    I'm not sure. I think at the beginning, it's said that it's 100 interviews. So definitely a large team at the beginning, maybe a minimum of 20/ 30 I'm not sure but I was maybe I just want to know, like 100 Is it the default number, like each project, for example, my startup you're gonna assign me 100 startups maybe less, maybe more, depending on my situation, depending on the cost as well. does happen when 100 persons costs more than having 50 Which which makes sense. But I was hoping to know what these numbers actually mean in terms of the size of the startups. So it's actually speaks to my to my to my size of the startup or to my startup what size to me to be precise. But yeah, overall, I think it's it's great. It's covers all the tricks all the points for me to be honest     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  23:21    Okay, so for the next section what do you think? Like, what's your overall impression about this section?     Yassine Tabouti  23:40    First of all, it's always nice to see the team behind the behind the solution or behind the product. So you can maybe search who's who the founder is, who is in charge of partnerships. So it's, it definitely adds to the credibility aspect. We talked about at the beginning, when you see brands when you see who is the team building the product. When this you see your surgeon you see their vision why they're doing what they're doing, so it definitely adds it makes me more confident to try this dissolution. My opinion.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani 24:17    And what's the thing that like, we're using Ai faces?      Yassine Tabouti  24:30    I think it's I'm not sure if these are their true facesor  are just generated by by AI. is it the true face just animated.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani 24:44    Okay, it's just generated . What does this means to you?     Yassine Tabouti  24:54    I personally don't know them. So I wouldn't know for sure that if this is the right person, or it's estimated, but I would, I would, it would show me more credibility would be more confident to to opt in in giving my information. Okay.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  25:12    So I have a question. What do you think about the logo?     Yassine Tabouti  25:18    The logo, let me just get back. I think I saw it. Briefly. Yes. This is it. External logo expert but I think it's it's a little bit generic, but extern I think I think it can be better. Maybe be the name can be more more direct, I believe. So I don't understand. I don't understand the logo. But to be honest, in my in my standards, I think it's, it does. It gets the job done. And like Excuse me. I said in my opinion, I think it's it gets the job done. It's clear. It's okay.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  26:12    Okay, cool. What do you think that we don't have a tagline in our website? What does it give to?     Yassine Tabouti  26:27    I noticed that I think it gives a I wouldn't say an amateurish vibe. I would say it's maybe maybe in the testing phase, I would say maybe you're also validating your idea as well. So I'm not I'm not very into UI UX, but I didn't mind it to be honest. I was. What caught my attention is the is the title. It does speak to me so I didn't pay attention. To time to be honest. If     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  27:01    I say can you like when you saw the products you understand? What are we what we're doing? Can you like give me a suggestion suggestion about a tagline?     Yassine Tabouti  27:29    Let me think     maybe you your all in one product market fit solution.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani 27:51    Okay, make sense? Okay. So now that you checked all the websites, what would you do when you jump to get started?     Yassine Tabouti  28:01    Yeah, yeah, definitely. 100% I think it's something I would like to get more information about. So you just click right on this does it does it work? Yes. Speak with one of our experts.     So what was your question please?     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  28:41    Okay, so, like when you jump here, what do you want to do? In this step, we do like feel this information?     Yassine Tabouti  28:56    Oh, yes, yes, yes, definitely. So     Kawtar Ait oulahyani 28:59    and why that? What do you want like you want to from our team to connect with you?     Yassine Tabouti  29:10    Yes, yes, definitely. Like I said, I'm interested to know about more about the solution. The previous sections did sparked a lot of my interest. So yes, I would I would fill the form.     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  29:26    Okay, so now that you you know, the product so were you able to find what you were looking for easily?     Yassine Tabouti  29:41    What do you mean?     Kawtar Ait oulahyani  29:43    Like when you when you when you were scrolling? In the website, like you were looking for something that aligned with you and aligns with what your experience like did it? Did you find what you were looking for easily or not?     Yassine Tabouti: 30:00     I think the website is concise. It states the obvious solution. It’s general but states clearly the solution.

I think it would speak to me even more ",," To be honest, if it's if the solution stops wasting time or burning cash, I'm already interested because like I said early on, we already wasted time trying to validate the product.

I would say, Yeah, we did waste a little bit of time in the beginning kind of just not knowing who to talk to. So I guess there's one big way we wasted time. Other than that, I wouldn't say there was any like wasted time it was kind of just learning. Obviously, could have been expedited, but I wouldn't say it was like explicitly wasted burning cash. I think we burned a little bit of cash during the r&amp;d phase, but we didn't really burn any cash like doing any sort of customer discovery, your acquisition. Okay. And then building the wrong product was not really an issue for us, because we talk to customers first. Right.

So I guess that part is what appeals the most to kind of saves you all the time and hassle doesn't really appeal as much, to me personally is the fact that we already kind of did it. Okay, yeah. enjoy doing it. So I personally wouldn't find too much value in something like this, but I definitely see someone would.

Global Equity Fund,Ujjwal Chand,seed,investment and investment/trading solutions,https://globalequityfund.com.np/,B2B & B2C,Investment Management,"Started as a engineer, shifted into investing and co-founded investment solutions platform", https://otter.ai/u/Dq3RnnKrZFl4Yn0N0uV-FW67tZU?utm_source=copy_url , partially resonated," Okay, okay. I think this this should be. Good, expertly. We'll get you through again. sighs Nick compaign. He's. So how did this come into picture? So expert lead? Where does this come into picture? The solution that you're trying to provide? Right? That would be interviews, product market fit, interviews, analysis, and then some sort of some sort of your assessment on that, right? Where does customer, your industry veterans come into picture?  industry part of the solution, right? The recommendation or the assessment that you're trying to give? That should be part of this, this thing, right. And then after you've got all the data that you assess, and then you try to find a solution, or give them some sessions, that should be included over here? So I think I know if you can dissociate this, these two parts? I don't know if so how will industry veterans give you incise? Before getting any data, so you need. So I don't know how this will happen. Maybe what you can do is give them a maybe maybe you can just have a fully managed thing where you have industry veterans giving critical insight as well. And then maybe another maybe would be saving man is kind of thing where you do the interviews, you give them data, you give them whatever raw insights that you have, and then through the startups will use that data, that assessment to have their own decisions. So that could be one thing on which staff your extensive with 100% teams, larger teams means more results faster, better, and efficient teams. I don't know how all this this is going to be a value proposition. Right. So I know how this would be a solution. I don't know. I'm not getting this part properly. Could you elaborate on this?  No, I think you have fully mass part right, right. And then you can have semi mass part and then you can also have it Express, maybe our maybe a kind of like some sort of, for large project teams, I get what you're trying to say we are right now. But it could be given a different message, right? It would be on the same solution, but then how you want, how far she went? And how elaborate you want the interviews, that would be covered in this part, right. So I cannot think of anything right now. But But I think this needs to be messaged in a different way. Maybe you say a senior manager kind of thing. And then you could have these would be one option. And then then within these, you could have another option like you could have a normal normal service or you could have an expedited expedited service, where you will get data report faster, and then you can reach large customers and that that you could get a break, right? So the this segregation would be within this.    "," So like I said, I need to know like, so we have about 10 minutes left, okay, in the in this meeting. So like I said, this is a new concept for me, right? So new cars, not just new concept, a new company, promoting a product or service that I could need. So I do not know if I need to spend time on this company or so they go back to other companies that are providing similar services. So for me data, and then some testimonials would be much, much better for me to click on this makes sense. Because once I hook into your service, I need to have some some cash outflow, right? I need to pay for some some save some fees and everything. So for me to do that. And then also, I need to spend more time trying to understand how your team works. How are you going to give me solution? So for that to happen, I need to have that right. Right. So for that, I need to see some data, how you've helped others. And then maybe some testimonies from companies like SP tech ventures so that I can say, okay, I can trust these guys. And then I can go ahead. "," would be step two, right? This would be a step two, because this is your step one, everything because the product is not yet in the market. Am I wrong? Am I right? Or regarding this? I think in this case, what you're trying to see is whether your product is actually going to be fit in the market and whether you you will be getting enough customers or not right. So this should be your ultimate First product, all your alpha was unbeatable and whatever you call it. And then once you have a solution of this, and then you customize based on your analysis, your interviews, and then you launch the product, and then you get early customers, right, early adopters, and then you this should be a step to the second phase, if you're looking at furniture, so I don't think so you can club this part and this part, in same part ",,,,," Wasting time, Burning Cash, Building the wrong product "," So one thing right now is you spoken with startups, right? So we've worked with quite some startups as well as SMEs, small and medium sized enterprises, we've worked with them. And then one thing would, that would be quite hard, first of all, would be trying to convince them that they need support, right? Because startups, they kind of feel like they need to do everything by themselves, and then try to preserve cash and all this thing. So somehow, you need to find a pro proposition that says, you're actually helping them stop cash burn, right? So that is one thing you need to somehow tell them. Maybe you need some data, data, some graphs, some some testimonials, how you have helped certain companies to bring down their cost, maybe numbers, maybe in percentage before and after you went in how much percentage of your tax burden was reduced, or how much optics was reduced? That sort of data, I think would be much, much easier. Because I think most of the status right now they have some sort of financial knowledge. So they will understand numbers much better. The other time would be other thing would be also you could put off sudden, like suppose you've helped five or 10 companies, and how much time you've saved for them on average, and how much gas you've saved for them. And then how many times you've stopped them from going before and after? What is the condition for this this topic as well, so that if you can show that in numbers with testimonies, I think it'd be much much better to sell this thing. And regarding your question, yes, they were faced a lot of problems with startups. One thing that is very, very tricky for startups in our country is trying to convince the US founders and promoters that the path they're traveling is, is not the proper path. So, like you said, building the wrong product, this could be quite quite tricky for any entrepreneur to take in. So how do you send this message? I don't know, maybe you need to work about this. Because if you're going to tell a startup owner that he is building a wrong product, he will take it, he or she might take it in a very, very wrong way. So maybe you could keep like product acceptance level testing or something like that. You need to be a little more diplomatic in in the these wording, I guess? I think, apart from that, yes, we face problems with the products. And, and other other part, I think, if you're trying to serve startups, this might be good. Or you could also serve investment bankers for this as well. Because a lot of time, the team is building wrong product and services, because their incentive model is quite different. So for them, they have to, maybe maybe the companies have to build a product soon enough, without testing in the market. So their incentive is to finish the product as soon as possible. So once you come in, and then you do your market research, and you said, No, this spirit won't work, you go for something else, I don't know how fast or how much experience you will get for from that. So that thing I think you need to work work on. Apart from that I think this is a good solution that you're trying to offer. ", partially , partial , partial ,, yes , partially , no ,, Extern solves for a better understanding. ," nothing like that. But I think a lot of the first thing that I, I just want to reiterate whatever I said earlier, right. So the design is minimalistic, but I think you need to have more information in one piece. Further, you don't need to scroll down a lot, at least four people, your potential customers, once you have the customers, and then you have all your requests, then you can give them more information about your product, or different types of other products that you have that you have. And all those things, right. So first thing is you need because you're trying to reach customers that are not already your customers, the potential customers, so they do not trust. They don't have that much trust right now. So in order to build that, first, you need testimonials you need maybe even your team, I think with some LinkedIn profiles, so that we could decide on whether we can trust the people or not. That also could could be there. Apart from that, I think I think this is fine. This is fine. But it could be more compact, the design could be more compact. People do not like to scroll down so much and try to see what services you're providing and all this thing. So if you may I can give you a link. Can I show you one one website that I really like about ", Add more graphs and visuals that will help people understands quickly. Draw the people in quickly to the idea of this. Some parts need to be removed or changed as elaborated above. Overall good idea but did not feel compelling enough.
